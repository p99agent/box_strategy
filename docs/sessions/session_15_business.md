## Tax Efficiency: Hobby vs Business

### As a Hobbyist
- Earn income at day job
- Pay taxes first
- Buy equipment with after-tax money
- No deductions for trading expenses

### As a Business
- Earn income from trading
- Deduct expenses first
- Pay taxes on remaining profit
- Computer, software, education = deductible

> *"It's how much you get to keep that determines your wealth."*
