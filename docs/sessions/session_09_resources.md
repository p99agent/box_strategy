## Core Theoretical Foundations

### 1. Brownian Motion in Finance
**What to Google**: "Brownian motion in finance"

#### Key Concepts
- Random walk within predictable bounds
- High probability on left side of bell curve
- Exploiting consistency from chaos

> *"This is what we're doing, but we're doing it on the left side where probabilities of success are a lot higher."*

### 2. Bayes' Theorem
**What to Google**: "Bayes theorem" or search YouTube

#### Key Concepts
- Updating probabilities with new data
- Function of the bell curve
- How time and price blend together

> *"It's the backbone for what we're doing."*

## The Two Theoretical Pillars

| Theory | Application |
|--------|-------------|
| Brownian Motion | Price moves randomly but within bounds |
| Bayes' Theorem | Use past data to predict probability |

Together they create the **Price and Time Cycle**.

## Core Patterns and Axioms

### Universal Application
Applies to:
- Any instrument (forex, futures, stocks)
- Any time frame (1-min to monthly)
- Any market session

### The Core Patterns
```
Pattern 1: Push → Standard move in trend direction
Pattern 2: Pullback → Counter-move within trend
Pattern 3: Reversal → Direction change
```

### Using Patterns with Boxes
1. Calculate box from historical data
2. Apply box to current price action
3. Follow axioms (bounce or break)
4. Stack boxes as moves unfold

> *"One leads to the other, which leads to the other, which leads back to number one. Rinse, wash, repeat."*

## Where You Are in the Big Picture

### Daily Candle Position
| Position | What You're Building |
|----------|----------------------|
| Near LOW | Bottom wick |
| Near HIGH | Top wick |
| In middle | Body of candle |

### Session-Based Context
| Session | Typical Activity |
|---------|------------------|
| Asia | Range building (low volatility) |
| Europe | Body building, trending |
| US | Wick completion, reversal potential |

## The Next Move Philosophy

### Trade the NEXT Move
> *"These core patterns, these axioms kind of force you to trade the next move instead of chasing what's happening right now."*

### Avoiding the Bag
Common mistakes:
- Stuck at the top
- Stuck at the bottom
- Holding the bag

**Solution**: Plan for the NEXT trade, not the current one.
