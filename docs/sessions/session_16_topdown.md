# Session 16: Mastering Top-Down Analysis for Scalping Success

---

## The Top-Down Framework

### The Hierarchy
```
Daily Chart    → Direction for the day (IDEA)
Hourly Chart   → Range and key levels (PLAN)
5-Minute Chart → Action points (ROAD MAP)
1-Minute Chart → Actual trades (EXECUTE)
```

> *"Top down, not bottom up. Bottom up is an excuse to stick around a bad trade."*

---

## Daily Chart Analysis

### Step 1: Compare Today vs Yesterday
- Is today's high > yesterday's high?
- Is today's low > yesterday's low?
- HH + HL = Bullish structure
- LH + LL = Bearish structure

### Step 2: Check ADR (Average Daily Range)
- How much has already moved today?
- How much room is left?
- If ADR exceeded → expect reversal

---

## Hourly Chart Analysis

### Define Your Playing Field
1. Identify the most recent HIGH
2. Identify the most recent LOW
3. This is your current range

### Scenarios
| Price Position | Expectation |
|----------------|-------------|
| Near high of range | Expect pullback or break |
| Near low of range | Expect bounce or break |
| Middle of range | Wait for edge |

## 5-Minute Chart: The Road Map

### Create Action Points
- Mark past levels that worked as S/R
- These are "rungs on a ladder"
- Price revisits them over time

> *"These rungs on the ladder are action points. One way or another, over time, we revisit these."*

---

## 1-Minute Chart: Execution

### With Your Boxes Ready
1. Stack boxes from most recent swing
2. Wait for price to reach box edge
3. Enter based on bias + box alignment
4. Target 3 pips

---

## Geographic Adjustments

### For US Traders (10:00 AM ET Start)
- Use Daily chart (16+ hours of history)
- Asia + Europe already complete
- More reference points

### For European Traders
- Use 4-Hour chart instead
- Only Asia session history
- Less reference points

## Key Quotes

1. *"By picking the right side, you're simplifying your life for the next couple of hours."*

2. *"I'm only here for 2 hours each day, so I'm not looking very far."*
