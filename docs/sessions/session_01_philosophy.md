## Core Concept: Trading Ranges FOR REWARD

The key insight is focusing on **reward extraction**, not risk-to-reward ratios.

> *"I'm not focused on a risk to reward ratio. I'm focused solely on the reward. And I am managing the risk."*

## The Insurance Company Model

| Insurance Company | Box Strategy |
|-------------------|--------------|
| Collects many small premiums | Takes many small profits (3 pips) |
| Rarely pays claims | Rarely takes losses |
| Actuarial risk management | Statistical probability management |

---

## Psychology: Why This Approach Works

### The Problem with Traditional Trading
- Series of losses → Operating from **fear hormones**
- Fear → Avoid taking risks instead of managing them
- Gives up → Under-confidence, irrational pessimism

### The Box Strategy Solution
- Many small wins → Operating from **testosterone** (reward-seeking)
- Exciting, pleasurable, consistent
- Risk: May become **overconfident** → Need risk management discipline

## Instrument Selection Criteria

### AVOID (Trending Pairs)
| Pair Type | Reason |
|-----------|--------|
| XXX/USD | Safe haven, trends more |
| XXX/JPY | Safe haven, trends more |

### PREFER (Ranging Pairs - Crosses)
| Pair | Reason |
|------|--------|
| **EUR/GBP** | Geopolitically stable neighbors, range-bound |
| **EUR/CHF** | EU-Switzerland stable relationship |
| **GBP/CHF** | Cross pair, limited trending |

> *"The European Union is not gonna poke the eye out of Britain and vice versa."*

---

## Time Frame Selection

### Capital-Based Decision
| Account Size | Time Frame | Stop Size |
|--------------|------------|-----------|
| Millions | Daily chart | Large (60+ pips) |
| Smaller | Intraday (1-min) | Small (10-15 pips) |

> *"If you operate with millions, you're trading on the daily chart as though it's the one minute chart."*

---

## When to Trade: Time of Day

### Key Considerations
- Trade **after** news events, not during
- Be aware of event risk schedule
- Trade during your session's active hours

### Session Approach
- All 24 hours are NOT for trading
- Only a handful per day worth attention
- Match your trading to professional institutional schedules

---

## The Core Philosophy

### Drawdown as Tool, Not Enemy
> *"Instead of hiding from drawdown, we're gonna put it to use."*

### Key Mindset Shifts
1. Ask what the market is **willing to give**, not what you want
2. If market gives 3 pips consistently, ask for 3 pips many times
3. Seek to **manage risk**, not avoid it
4. Focus on **behavior consistency**, not outcome chasing

## Key Quotes

1. *"The market is like an ocean. It moves up and down. We can't control what it does. We can control how we behave."*

2. *"If it's willing to give you 3, ask for 3. Maybe 10 times."*

3. *"The solution rests between our ears."*
