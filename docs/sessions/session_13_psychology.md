# Session 13: Psychology of Successful Scalping

---

## Baby Steps to Big Dreams

### The Core Principle
> *"Within the first few trades, we kind of give up the idea of baby steps and immediately jump into home runs."*

| Wrong Approach | Right Approach |
|----------------|----------------|
| Leap to success | Baby steps |
| Home runs | Base hits |
| Immediate failure | Gradual growth |

## The Law of Large Numbers

### Swing Trading Sample
- 1000 trades over 10 years
- Each trade independent
- High variability

### Scalping Sample
- 1000 trades in couple months
- Series of trades create track record
- Low variability per series

> *"Each day is its own track record. We just happen to tack it on to the day before."*

---

## The Single Variable Change

### From Swing to Scalp
| Before | After |
|--------|-------|
| 2:1 R:R target | 3 pips target |
| 40+ pip stops | 36 pip max stop |
| Few trades | Many trades |
| Low win rate | High win rate |

> *"By changing that one variable, the target, makes it achievable, repeatable, consistent."*

## The Hormone Effect

### Losing (Cortisol + Adrenaline)
- Operating from fear
- Brain rewires to avoid risk
- Physical symptoms possible
- Irrational pessimism develops

### Winning (Testosterone)
- Operating from reward-seeking
- Exciting, pleasurable
- Want to repeat success
- Risk: Overconfidence

## The Peacock Warning

> *"When everybody is trying to blow the doors off, we're just trying to stay in the groove."*

### Danger Zones
- Feeling invincible → STOP
- Best day ever → STOP
- One more trade → DON'T
- Irrational exuberance → WALK AWAY

## Core Patterns and Axioms

### Axiom 1: Testing Support/Resistance
- You're testing a hypothesis
- Confirmation = profit
- Failure = move to next trade

### Axiom 2: Trend Initiation
- Failed support = trend starting
- Not panic, just information

### Axiom 3: Momentum Measurement
- Pivot distance = momentum
- Clues for reversal

---

## The Missing Piece: Time Axis

### Industry Focus
- Price only
- Buy low, sell high
- Wait (for what?)

### Our Focus
- Price AND Time
- Cycles and duration
- Know when to exit

> *"Nobody has told you what it is you were waiting for."*

---

## Preemptive Trading

> *"We are the confirmation that everybody else is waiting for."*

### How It Works
1. Others wait for confirmation
2. We provide liquidity
3. When they buy, we already profited
4. We sell them the top

## Risk Manager vs Trader

### Two Different Jobs
| Trader | Risk Manager |
|--------|--------------|
| Opens trades | Closes trades |
| Follows strategy | Protects capital |
| Looks for entries | Engineers exits |
| Gets in | Gets out |

---

## Key Psychology Parameters

| Aspect | Guideline |
|--------|-----------|
| Daily goal | Average, not world record |
| Hormones | Seek reward, not avoid loss |
| After reaching goal | STOP |
| When wrong | Add, don't panic |
| Identity | Business operator, not gambler |

---

## Key Quotes

1. *"Even a demo account can be hurtful to your psyche if you put a lot of effort into creating the perfect track record."*

2. *"Learn to lose before you learn to win."*

3. *"3 pips is 98% achievable. We start with 70% win rate and crank it up to the high 90s with practice."*
