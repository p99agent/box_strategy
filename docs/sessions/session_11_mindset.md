# Session 11: Mindset of the Scalper

---

## The Insurance Company Mindset

### How Insurance Companies Operate
- Collect many small premiums
- HATE paying claims
- Send adjusters to deny losses
- Look at every angle to not pay

### Apply This to Trading
> *"We have to operate with the same mindset."*

| Insurance Company | Your Trading |
|-------------------|--------------|
| Collects premiums | Collects 3-pip wins |
| Avoids claims | Avoids 36-pip losses |
| Sends adjusters | Engineers exits |
| Denies when possible | Finds break-even |

---

## Risk Allocation vs Profit Expectation

### The Numbers
| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Risk allocated | 4% (available) |
| Risk actually used | 1% (typical) |
| Daily profit target | 0.25-0.3% |
| Multi-day goal | Average over 4-5 days |

> *"We're not hoping to use the 4% to make money. We're hoping to use 1% to make maybe 0.25% that day."*

---

## Not Trying to Beat the Bank

### Lower Expectations = Better Outcomes
> *"I'm not trying to beat the bank at its own game. I just want to be averaged over the course of 4 or 5 days in a row."*

### Psychological Relief
When you aim for average:
- No pressure to perform
- Do what you CAN do
- Almost with eyes closed
- Like a business on schedule

## The McDonald's Analogy

### Employee Guidebook Mindset
> *"It's like working at McDonald's, your first day on the job, you have your employee guidebook. Everything you need to know is in that guidebook."*

### Key Points
- Follow the rules
- Know the limits
- Don't deviate
- Get fired at pip 36 (lose your job)

---

## Treat Your Account Like a Newborn

### Protective Mindset
> *"Think of your trading account or your prop account as a newborn baby."*

You would:
- Do anything to protect it
- Book a loss if necessary
- Not risk its life for greed
- Make decisions from care, not fear

---

## Prop Firm Mentality

### Budget Thinking
> *"If they limit your losses to $5000, you are therefore operating a $5000 account."*

### Practical Application
| Prop Account | Your Reality |
|--------------|--------------|
| $100,000 capital | Not your money |
| $5,000 loss limit | YOUR actual limit |
| Split in half | $2,500 for bad days |
| 2 bad days allowed | Then you're done |

## Probability Focus vs R:R Focus

### Swing Trader Mindset
- Focus on risk:reward ratio
- Must be positive R:R
- Accept series of losses

### Scalper Mindset (This Strategy)
> *"I moved away from that mindset. I'm focused on probabilities."*

### Trade Criteria
For me to take a trade:
1. Must have probability of making 3 pips
2. Usually stems from support or resistance
3. If criteria met → very likely to trade

## The Baseball Analogy

### Not Trying for Home Runs
> *"I'm not trying to hit it out of the park."*

### Base by Base
- Get to 1st base (3 pips)
- Maybe 2nd base (another 3 pips)
- Maybe 3rd base (another 3 pips)
- Do this 5-6 times per day
- Done more than enough

---

## The Reverse Psychology

### Everyone Else
- Trying to blow doors off statistics
- Going for superhero trades
- Different (bad) outcomes

### Box Strategy
- Stay in the groove
- Be boring
- Steady as she goes
- Average is the goal

> *"Everybody that tries to be the superhero ends up with very different outcomes."*

---

## The 4-Box Freedom

### Why 4 Boxes Give Freedom
- Room to be wrong
- Room to fix mistakes
- Room to average
- Room to find break-even

> *"The 4 boxes give you the freedom to come out with average results."*

## Key Mindset Parameters

| Aspect | Guideline |
|--------|-----------|
| Daily goal | 0.25-0.3% |
| Risk used | 1% typical |
| Mindset | Insurance company |
| Approach | Business, scheduled |
| Outcome | Average, consistent |
| Avoid | Hero trades |

---

## Key Quotes

1. *"The psychology is reverse. When everybody is trying to blow the doors off, we're just trying to stay in the groove."*

2. *"If you want to keep your job, don't let it go to pip 36."*

3. *"Average good, average bad, average. This is the key—it's average."*
