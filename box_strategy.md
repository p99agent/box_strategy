## 01 module 1 philosiphy of trading ranges for reward aac

Good morning, good afternoon. Good evening, everyone. Uh, today's topic, trading volatility, using the boxes. I'm looking forward to. Showing you what I've been working on. So, what are we going to be learning today? Uh, basically, why I choose to trade ranges for reward. Uh, what pairs are better than others, not so, not all pairs are adequate. Uh, some do range more, and some range less, and we'll touch on that. Uh, where to trade ranges, so time frames, some are better than others, they're not all the same and uh when to trade ranges, so time of day we do want to be, uh, cautious of, you know, event risk and so on. And then finally we'll touch on how I trade the ranges uh in order to extract momentum from the volatility that we have. All of that is done using probabilities, and we're looking at levels on the chart while we're trying to exploit drawdown. Instead of hiding from drawdown, uh instead of uh. Running away from drawdown, we're gonna put it to use. And so we, we do have a uh a methodology and uh it's been in the making for a long, long time. My name is Jean Francois Bouchet. I'm, I'm a trading agency, so to speak. I'm based in Jasper National Park in Canada. I've been doing this, as you see here since 2008. Uh, I started in 2008, but I was not profitable in 2008. So, uh, we'll make sure to, you know, highlight that fact. It's a long game, it's not something you can learn instantly. You, you have to put in the effort. No thinking in the big picture, uh, the market is like an ocean. It moves up and down. We can't really control what it does. We can, however, control how we behave and we can adjust our sales. In order to get to our destination, right? The ocean will be the ocean, the destination does not have to change. We can adjust our behavior. To get to where we need to go. The idea behind trading ranges for reward, right? It's the, the key here is for reward. I'm not focused on a risk to reward ratio. I'm focused solely on the reward. And I am managing the risk. So the ratio itself, the statistic. Is the thing that's furthest away from my mind, right? I'm, I'm not focusing on a risk to reward statistic. I, I focus on the reward and the win rate in order to overcome the losses. But the losses by design are accounted for. And so, the model that I use is an insurance company model, right? So, I'm taking in many, many, many, many, many, many small returns. And I seldomly pay out. On a claim or a loss, right? The whole strategy is hyper process focused, so it's checklists, rules. And discretion on top. Right? So it's all of that combined helps to fulfill a psychological requirement that I have. Some of us need to hear, good job, good job, good job, multiple times per day. And when we're trading longer term, we tend to have a series of losses. So if you're looking at a statistical goal, 2 to 13 to 1. Uh, reward to risk, you're likely going to face a series of losses. And over time series of losses. Kind of rewire your brain. To look to avoid to lose. And uh managing the loss or managing the risk is really what we aim to do, not running away from it, right? So, losing many, many times in a row, forces you to operate from an anxiety hormone standpoint, right? You're operating from fear. Uh Sometimes pain, you know, ulcers. Uh, you're gonna be afraid to take risks where we need to be managing risk. And if you do this long enough and you lose many, many deposits, and you eventually give up hope, and you walk away under confidence and irrational pessimism. Kicks in, right? You start to blame the market, you start to feel like you're a victim of the market, and you feel targeted by the market. And in reality, all we have to do to change all of this. Is adjust one parameter and change the target. So instead of asking Mr. Market, please give me 20, because I'm willing to lose 10. If we just find out what the market is willing to give. And ask for that many times over. So if it's willing to give you 3, ask for 3. Maybe 10 times. And so all of a sudden we've changed one parameter. And we're now faced with a reward seeking behavior. It's like a mouse in a maze looking for cheese, and we find this cheese over and over and over. We're now operating from testosterone, very different hormone. This is exciting, it's pleasurable. I bounce out of bed to do this every day. I seek to manage this type of risk. But I'm left with another psychology issue, right? I'm somewhat overconfident and maybe sometimes even irrational exuberance takes over, and I end up getting my head delivered on the silver platter, right? So, risk management is is part of the equation, that's what we aim to do. And that's the key, right? It's between our ears. The solution rests between our ears, and what we have here is a way of unlocking the success that we've all been chasing. Right, so it's a way of creating a stream of income. While we're learning to trade, right? While we're learning to lose professionally, right? So in the end, what you end up having to do is pace yourself, lower the bar as low as the bar can go. And then as the bar is lowered, you have to raise your personal standards, right? So as a as a swing trader focusing a positive risk to reward ratio. You tend to have a loss. Uh, a stop loss that, you know, stops your trade. What I aim to do is stop the trade by myself. The stop loss is, in effect, uh, an ejection seat to protect the account. It's not to stop the trade itself, so, uh, what pairs are better than others? Well, to put, to keep it really, really simple, we want to avoid safe haven pairs, right? So anything that has the yen in it or the USD part of the equation will tend to have, uh, trends more so than ranges or more so than we need. And so if I'm looking for a ranging instruments, I will remove the USD and I'll remove the yen. I'll remove uh. Some of the trending instruments from the equation, leaving me only with crosses and overall these crosses tend to have ranges more so than trends. The ranges themselves, if you stack them up, make a trend. And so we see the trend by making the range and stacking the range and we play the ranges and so the instrument we choose to trade is usually a function of where we live and the time we have access to trade, right? So 24 hours a day. All 24 hours are not for trading, right? There's only a handful per day that are worth our our attention. Depending on where you are, you may be looking, you know, in Europe, geopolitical stuff neighbors to neighbors, there's nothing here that will rock the boat, you know, the European Union is not gonna. You know, poke the eye out of Britain and vice versa, right? So this is not gonna be at risk of geopolitical danger of any kind. Well, we had Brexit, nothing broke. Right, so we can see this type of stuff ranges are limited, nothing is running out of control, right, because of the geopolitical neighborhood, right? Same thing here, right? There's no, there's no reason to see the European Union or. Switzerland, you know, interfere with each other, right? This is not gonna go to the South Pole. This is not going to go to the moon. For any reason, right? It's range bound by geography. Right, the same thing here. Right, so these are all the best types of environment for us looking for ranges, right? Nothing here on the outside on a macro scale will interfere with our upper and lower boundaries. Right, so that's the kind of stuff we have to think about, uh, risk management. On, uh, multiple levels and where to trade the ranges, that depends on how much money you're capitalized with, right? How much money is your business, your trading business. Operating with Uh, if you operate with millions, you're trading on the daily chart. As though it's the one minute turn. It's your smallest time frame. And if you don't have that kind of money, you're probably trading intra day. Right, because it's easier and cheaper to lose. When you can actually, you know, manage the loss, 10 pips, 15 pips, it's a lot more manageable than a whole day, 60 pips.


## 02 module 2 assumptions and basics aac

Right, so in order for us to figure out where we want to trade ranges, you need to understand how much are you willing to risk in in percentage and then uh what it is you're trying to extract from the market, right? Ask the right questions how much am I trying to make and how long do I want to make it how long do I want to dedicate to making it. It's time for money and money for time. Right, so the ranges themselves are everywhere, right? And we're using this concept. On all time frames, so we're not picky, it depends on the money that we have and what it is we're trying to get, right? So if I choose to trade on an hourly chart. I'm using an hourly sized box with an hourly sized target. And I'm getting hourly size results, right? Potential average yield is very different on an hourly chart versus a one minute chart. And so my potential average yield, my paycheck. Comes from The time frame that I trade, the time of day that I choose to trade it with, and my average result every day. Right, so I'm really targeting potential average yield as a stream of income. To pay for my business expenses. Right, that's the bread and butter trades, 3 pips, 3 pips, 3 pips, 3 pips. And on top of that, I will do swing trading and you know, other things from the playbook to uh supplement the bottom line of the trading business, right? The key is to trade on the time frame that you, you can manage the losses within. Right, some people. Assume trading on the daily chart. Will give them better results, but they don't account for the bigger losses. All right, so that's kind of where we're coming from, the, the loss side of the equation. For, for the idea of scalping, you can extract from any time frame. It's basically a slice of price. So you can take a slice off the price on a 4 hour chart or on on a 1 hour chart. The, the idea behind scalping versus what I would consider a swing trade is for me the scalp is just a tiny tiny piece where the swing is the meat of the move. And so I find myself trading mostly the extremes of that move, while the swing trader is capturing the middle of the move. Right, so when I'm looking at trading ranges depending on the time frame that I'm looking for. Uh, or that I'm working at, the swing trader is looking for a breakout of that range. And I'm trying to bounce within that range, and so my scalps are defined by a floor and a ceiling. And I'm trading within that floor and that ceiling. Whereas the swing trader is trying to go beyond the floor or beyond the ceiling and so that potential average yield for for me is defined by my constant target, my constant behavior over time, whereas the swing trade, the income is from that risk to reward ratio. Right, so I'm focusing more on behavior. As the last variable, right? Everything else in my playbook is a constant. And so on for me, uh, I start on the one minute chart. As the time frame I want to be afford to lose right so I want to lose very, very little. And so I'm trading on the one minute chart. And at the same time, because I'm on the one minute chart, I'm getting paid little money. But I'm doing it consistently and over and over and over and so my potential average yield comes from the one minute chart but it's because I'm consistent there. Right, so the scalping is really just removing a little piece of the price. You can do that on any time frame. And from this approach, I happen to be doing that. Uh, on the one minute chart, and it is, it is the consistency that I'm seeking to extract, right? So I'm not chasing the. I'm not chasing the money, I'm chasing the repetition, the behavior, right? And then that's what ends up paying me, uh, in the end. And then when I trade, because I'm based in North America, I'm focusing my efforts on a very specific piece of the day, time slice. And so I'm comparing apples with apples, right? I'm not trading at random. I don't trade on my lunch hour, you know, I'm, I'm trading as a business with business acumen and business hours. And just like any other business, I close my doors and I go home every day. Right, and that's, that's part of the strategy and then when we discovered that, you know, I'm not the only one doing this, the banks themselves have a schedule to follow the markets have a schedule to follow. The calendar is known by everyone one year in advance and so the risk is known one year in advance, right? The market schedule is known globally so these are not random events, these are well known facts. And professional traders, even like mutual funds. Will operate on schedule like pension funds, mutual funds they'll spend the money on schedule. The money they collect, they spend it into the markets like a like clockwork, right? So we can see this behavior taking place and we can extract from that behavior. Certain cycles that we can jump on and take part in or, you know, uh, extract volatility from that flow that's coming through. Right, so every day I see this, I see the calendar, right? The, the calendar has news events and all that stuff. I wait for that news event and I, I trade after the news, right? So I wait for the event risk and I trade after the event risk. Same thing with the stock market opening, right? When the stock market opens, it usually brings with it a fair value move which will find its way to the to the spot market, right, the currency markets. And so we end up having flow coming through the currency market at that time of day. About 30 minutes later, the options expiry takes place. That's FX uh and equity markets. And that's another event risk we have to account for. And then, uh, shortly thereafter, you know, there's a bull or a bear pull back. Followed by another event, followed by another event we have a schedule of professionals doing professional things on schedule that induces a certain behavior in the market that we can kind of see coming. And then and take part in anticipate that behavior so instead of getting surprised by it we see it coming. Right, so I see the expiration coming. I'm prepared for it. I see the bear or the bull pull back. I'm prepared for it. Instead of being surprised by any volatility, I know why that volatility is scheduled. Right? So, it's an important piece because if I, if I shift my workday by 1 or 2 hours in any direction, the whole system falls apart or behaves very differently. And this behavior right there is repeated 2 more times. Right, it's repeated uh during the European session and it's repeated during the Asian session. And so this behavior happens. To everyone. We just have to be aware that it's there and then we can extract from it, you know, and so the the is awareness and in my world I aim to make money with plan A 3 Pips, 3 pips, 3 Pips, and while I'm trying to make money, my mind is always on the lookout for Plan B. What if what if plan A doesn't work? I have to, you know, use Plan B. And so how do I trade the ranges? Right, time of day we talked about that. I, I use many, many, many, many, many small trades. The idea behind the trades themselves is to take risk and spread it. Right, so instead of taking one trade and hoping that everything works well. I'm taking the same amount of risk. But I will break it up and spread it. And so I'm using many probabilities to find success, right, it's the same amount of risk that a swing trade. Would take, but I'm breaking it up into smaller pieces, so I have more probabilities for the same trade. And then uh using only small position sizes, tiny, tiny, tiny, so that's the breakup of that percentages. We can manage risk and the money. Right, so if I see a move like this, a bullish trend. In my world, I'll be selling. Or buying the range while everybody else is trying to play the breakout. And so while I'm trying to do this 3 or 4 times. I'm recycling my trades. While someone else is waiting for theirs. When they do find their trade, I may be in trouble. I, I may be trying to sell this. And the breakout now has me in trouble. The theory is that it's not a random event. It's a standard move. And I can fix something here. I can engineer something. To come out of this troubled spot, right? So while everybody else is focusing on. Uh, the breakout, my job is to focus on the next move, right? So I'm selling this because the next move is down. I'm selling this because the next move is down. I I was selling this. Because the probability. Was down. Right, so I trade a probability based on what the next move should be building the positions, right? So if I sell once I sell twice maybe I sell 3 times I'm, I'm spreading my risk. And because I'm choosing to spread my risk, I'm looking for an average. Right, and so this average, I end up building it or layering in. By following specific core patterns and axioms. OK, so everybody on the planet that starts to trade is learning how to play breakouts. And I went in the opposite direction. I went to learn to trade bounces first. And that changed everything, right now I have small achievable, repeatable goals. I look for the next move. I build positions to take advantage of draw down instead of being worried about it, you know, being afraid of draw down. And I'm following core events, core patterns to guide me forward.


## 03 module 3 axioms of trading aac

So it's not a random choice that I'm selling at the top or I'm buying at the bottom. I'm doing it because I'm anticipating something. And that anticipation is I a. A core event. It's something that happens over and over and over. It's just a matter of time. When we're looking at the core patterns, we're looking at this up here. It's either bouncing. Or it is not bouncing. So rule number one. If I'm going to be testing for support. On any time frame, there's no mention of time here. If I'm testing for support, I know I have found support. When the price moves up. And that move is caused by demand. That is an undeniable fact. And so my job is to test for support on any time frame. I happen to be doing it on the one minute chart, and if I find support, it bounces on the one minute chart and one bounce, one little bar is enough to make me money. And so I make money because of the bounce. And if it does not bounce, right, so this is a bounce and I make money. If it does not bounce. Then it becomes rule number 2, right? A trend will start with the failure of support or resistance. And so I'm testing for the bounce, and if I don't get the bounce, I know I'm getting a trend. And the distance between these pivots is the best way to measure momentum. And momentum is a forward looking indicator. And so if I'm trying to figure out what is happening to the momentum. I can see through the pivots. I can look at the past pivots and kind of see a probability of the future, right? So if I'm looking at this here, the space between these failed bounces. The space is large, medium. Sometimes there's even a small one. That indicates or signs to a reversal right the the next move is turning around. You can see the same thing on the way up, right? The space between the swings is getting smaller and smaller and that leads to a turn in the opposite direction and we see this on any time frame just like we recognize breakouts, we recognize breakdowns, right? These events are happening everywhere. And my boxes encompass this. Right, so by using the box within the box, I'm looking for rule number one. And on the outside of the box, I'm looking for rule number 2 and rule number 3. Right, so this axioms is what drives the boxes. And in the boxes, I aim for support or resistance. OK, so I'm targeting support or resistance to make my money. And if I cannot find it, my job is to fix those trades. And I do that with more trades that's the insurance policy that's the insurance company model, right? Uh, we are willing to take on a little bit more risk because we know statistically it will create a smaller loss, right? We can find break even. And so by looking for break even. We can avoid losing 36 peps. Right, so the 36 Pips exit is an emergency exit. Our job is to make 3 pips or engineer something that is not 36 pips, and the engineering we will address in a minute. Right? So, the box itself, uh, where does the box come from? Well, it comes from the market. It's not something we create, it's not something we imagined, it's something we measure. We just measure the past, right? So it's not something you want to measure at random and so by operating as a business you wanna measure your business hours, right? So you wanna. If you operate between the hours of 8 and 10, go and look at yesterday's price action at 10 o'clock. And measure the swings back towards 8 o'clock, the start time. And the swings themselves are what you are tabulating. Averaging, and it yields a specific box. It will yield and, you know, an average, just like you see here, right? So, this little blue move here, 4 blue bars. That was 25 pips. And 4 bars and so we, we tabulate 25 pips, 4 bars. The next move, 50 pips, 6 bars, we do the same thing, right? 50 pips, 6 bars. And so on and so forth. If you measure approximately 10 or 12 swings, you'll have a really good sample, right? So you wanna measure a dozen or so swings. You wanna do this maybe on a 5 minute chart. Right, and so average the swings that you measure in real life. In this example. We have measured 4 swings, so we add the 4 measurements and divide by 4. We do the same thing with the number of bars, right? 4 bars, 6 bars, 8 bars, 10 bars. And in this case, we only did 4 swings and so we divide by 4. Right, for the sake of the example. This box is 7 bars long based on the past. And 37 pips tall. Based on the past. Right, so what we have here, based on the past, is a standard deviation of a normal distribution. Right, so this box right there is right here at the top. And if we give ourselves one box on either side of the top, we catch about 63% or 68%. Of the data that we've, you know, we've calculated or may encounter. Right? 3 standard deviations. Not 3 boxes, 95%. And 4 boxes. 97%. Right, so by using only one box. And pretending or projecting the next move, right, so if I walk to the computer at 8 o'clock in the morning and I put my box on the most recent swing. And I can see we've moved 123456 bars, and I know an average move is 7 bars long, so this move. Is running out of probabilities. It's running out of time, right? It's already 6, and we know an average of 7 and so I buy bar 7. I am buying the probability that this move is finished, and according to this, the next move is about to start. And according to this, the next move is 37 pips. Right, so if I'm using the box and I'm using it on time. It can give me an idea based on the past of what the potential is. Right, so if I buy bar 7. Based on the past. There is a chance that I get 50 pips more than the average. And likewise, based on the past. If I buy bar 7, there's a chance I get less. Than the average. Just like we do a few times before. Right, so this is just a frame. And it let me see what the market is capable of. And what is average? And my job is to try and make 3 pips inside of this box, right? This box is a standard move. I can see it go past. I can see it go exactly. I can see it go less. And sometimes it does not work. And so when it does not work. I will move my box and try it 4 times. And then I stopped. Right, so it is working. In box number one Or I'm repairing box number one. With 3 more boxes looking for that move, right? Looking for that bounce. And so if it's uh I can go to my whiteboard, so with the box, we need to be looking at previous data. We need to be averaging previous data, right, so this swing 50 pips, 10 bars. This swing, 25 pips, 8 bars. This swing was 50 pips, 6 bars. This was 25 pips, 4 bars. If you average all of this together, so you average the bars together, you average the pips together, you get a certain box. This box is a standard. Uh, deviation of your distribution of your price. And so we understand what the market is capable of. Because that's what it has done in the past. Right, so I'm not asking for any more than this. I'm asking for something that is within this, so it's I'm asking for something that is less than average. And so I'm trying to make 3 pips, 3 pips, 3 pips, 3 pips, 3 pips, 3 pips across the box. And so as we're making 3 peps across the box, we're testing structure. And maybe the structure breaks and we continue. Maybe the structure holds and we bounce. Right, maybe we move the box this way. The box is only a frame of reference. It's like wearing glasses and it's only allowing me to see one box at a time, right? I don't want to see the future too far into the future. It's like forecasting the weather. And the weather too far into the future is unpredictable. And so I see the bullish market. I see the pullback. I put the box on the pullback and this box gave me what the potential is for the next move. And so if I buy the pull back. Based on averages. The potential is maybe I get more. It happened before. If I get more. I also moved the box because now we make a new high. And what we did not use in time. I will get in price. Right, I'm exchanging time for price. If I'm not using the time, I will receive price. That's one scenario. Right, scenario number 2. I come to work, I see the pullback in the bullish market. I put my box on bar number 7. I buy bar number 7 and 68% of the time. The market will give me exactly the the box. Because it happened before, it's the average of the past. Right, so if I buy the bottom of the pull back 68% of the time I receive an average box scenario number 2, right? So if I try scenario number 3. I come to work at 8 o'clock, bullish market, I see pullback, I buy pull back, maybe the market use all the time, and it only gives me a half the box. Like it do before. So this time, No time is left, all the time is gone. We did not change the structure. The new box will come here. And the next move is probably going here, 68% of the time. Right? It's just a probability, and I'm adjusting where the probability will go based on what I think is evolving inside the box, right? So the box is showing me. The potential move. And so scenario number 1, I get more, scenario number 2, I get exactly what I want. Scenario number 3, I get less. Still positive. Here's the best part. If I buy bar 7. And instead of going up, the market will go down. I will now buy bar number 8 and I will have two open trades. And so now I have a new box. And I am buying bar number 8. I have 2 open trades. I have 2 boxes, 2 trades looking for the same target. And if it's still not working, I will buy. Bar #9. And I can only do this for 4 attempts. I'm, I am not made of money. And so I will only try 4 times. To buy support. And when I find support, I make my money on all the on all of the open trades. OK, so I, I, I aim for one bar of profit. Right there, one bar of profit, and then I repeat and I repeat and I repeat and I repeat if it is not working. I try 4 times. And that's it. That's it. And so the the rest of the strategy is really a matter of uh. The rest of the strategy is a matter of understanding where we want to play every day, right? Uh how much, how much are you willing to extract. Right, so time and money go together. I if you're looking for a paycheck, you, you want to know how long will it take? To get paid This is what I tried to do, right? I want to have cash flow. Every day I want to be able to withdraw money. Every day, I wanna have a stream of income, which was impossible with swing trading.


## 04 module 4 risk guidelines aac

So when I when I start to do this box stuff, I realized that support and resistance is everywhere it's much more common than we think it's always consistent but it's not always effective, right? So sometimes the price will bounce, sometimes the price will go right through it. Right, but we try it anyways, right? So I'm always assuming a bounce. And if I'm on the one hour chart. And looking at the 1 hour chart, looking at doing this type of stuff, I'm looking to bounce about 9 pips. At support or resistance, if I'm doing this business on a 5 minute chart, I'm looking to bounce. Every 3 peps. Right, and the box itself, the easiest way to imagine what a box looks like. It's the volatility at rest. Right, so when there's nothing pushing or pulling on the market, so that would be, in my case, the Euro USD in the Asia session. When there's nothing to push or pull on the euro. The box at rest is 9 pips. And it is in real life 12 5 minute bars. Right, so the market. In real life, doing the measurements I showed you. It told us. The box is 9 pips and 12 5 minute bars. If you do the math, 12 5 minute bars is 1 hour, right? 61 minute bars. And so if you only trade the 5 minute chart with the box, you only have 12 bars in the box. The average bar is 4 pips. You have the potential of making 48 pips if you catch every bar. If you zoom into the box and you use a one minute chart. The average bar is 3 pips. And now there are 60 of them. Your potential for making money is now 180 pips. Right, and so the box is 9 pips. And there's 60 bars in the box. That is one standard deviation, right? So that is these two green lines here. And then on each side of this. We have normal and expected moves, right, so something a little bit bigger is normal. But if we go too far. That is a repair situation. We have to fix this. And if we go further than that. We we fall off the bell curve. This is a long tail stop, right? Long tail is a a wick on the daily chart, right? A wick is uh uh an event that did not last very long, right? A long tail would be the reaction to a news event. And we close at the opposite. End right? so it's momentary. This is why we need a stop loss to protect the account but my skills are managing the losers, right? The stop loss is only there in case of emergency. And when we operate in this fashion. On the one minute chart, the average target is a one minute bar, just one bar. The rest of the bars that make up the move. are a swing trade, right? The meat of the market, the meat of the move. I'm not looking for the meat of the move. I'm only looking for the bar that's bouncing. And so by looking at the bouncing and only capturing the bouncing. I'm leaving a lot of money on the table. But the money that I am taking is consistent. It's the same money over and over and over, and it's, it will end up looking something like this, because I only allocate. 1% or less. Per box. And I'm willing to use up to 4 boxes, right? 4 boxes. I, I'm looking to fix things. At a risk, right? I'm taking a risk like an insurance company. I'm willing to risk up to 4%. To fix a problem. And so if I lose, if the problem is unfixable. I lose that 4%. Right, so I'm risking 1%. If I must, I'm risking up to 4%. And the whole time I'm trying to make consistent returns. Every trade you see here, 3000 trades, every trade you see here is 3 pips, 3 pips, 3 pips. And so it's because of consistency. I can have an equity curve that looked like this. Right, it's, uh, I never changed the target, right? I never changed the size. I never changed the stop, I never changed my time of day. I am the last variable, right, my behavior, and because now I'm using a box. The box will have the same behavior. On all three sides of the box, right? So when we go to watch the video and when you watch me trade, you will see the edges of the box is where I tend to concentrate my efforts, right? The edges of the box. Is where the bounces take place. In the center of the box is less of a probability of a bounce. Right, so most of my trades are happening on the edges. And that's when I'm also prepared for the breakout. Right, so I'm playing the bounce, I'm pocketing the bounce, I'm putting that money in my pocket, but I'm always on the lookout for the breakup. And when the breakout comes in my mind, I know this is not a runaway train, it's a standard move and I can fix a standard move. It's just one box away, right? So the, the idea is that we keep control or in this case we take the control back. When we're swing trading, we open one trade and the market will decide the outcome. What I'm doing, I opened one trade in the box, but I have 3 or 4 more pieces. And so if I don't like that first piece, I have a choice. I can close it, or I can average with it, the other three pieces that belong in that box. And so it's an averaging game and I'm engineering. How to get out instead of letting it go all the way to my stop loss. Right, so it's a chess game, and I'm always thinking the next move. And in this case, being a probability. The next move is always two sided, right? It could be good, it could be bad. And so the current move is a high probability. The next move is the low probability outcome. Of the first move. And so we're, it's, it's having two trains of thought all the time, right? The high probability and the what if, and we focus on practicing what if. Right, the, the high probability takes care of itself. There's very little for me to do when I open the trade. I'm just waiting for support or I'm waiting for resistance. And because of the way we operate, the bounce off of support makes us money. And then we are left with repairing very, very few trades. The risk manager. piece of the equation does not do very much work, but when we do it, it's critical that it be done well because our losses can take away a week of work. Right, so in order to avoid that. The secret to all of this is to leave the casino every day. Every day I operate like a business. Pay your expenses like a business, right, so you earn a revenue, you pay your expenses. And then uh You know, you close your doors for the day, come back tomorrow and do it again. And those of us that have overtraded will understand why this is so critical, right? The market is not a 24 hour money machine. At best it may be worthwhile 4 or 5 hours per day. Of those 4 or 5, pick 2. And focus on that so the top down analysis is really where the the rubber meets the road, right? So if I do my top down analysis wrong, so if I pick the wrong bias, I'm still making money that day, but I'm in draw down and I'm probably finishing the day with open trades and so that can become a problem in the middle of the night or tomorrow. And so it's probably best to just go flat every day. And if you cannot go flat every day, book the loss. Right, so the 4% losing everything, like to have the worst day ever, it really is a progressive problem. It's not something that will just happen. It, it will get worse and worse and worse and worse. And so you have many, many, many, many chances of stopping, right? So it's not like because I take many, many clicks. Each click will have its own stop loss, right? So it's not like I lose all the clicks at the same time. I only close one or two trades. I I close what I need to close. I'm still engineering the next move, so a 4% loss, maybe every quarter. It's, it's rare. It's very rare because we don't over trade, right? The, the game, the aim of the game is to do, you know, 20 trades. 30 trades maybe and walk away. It's a game of consistency like you're you you're aiming to do what your potential is and no more no less, right? No over trading and so the only other problem that you'll have with this. Is the graduation, like it, it graduates to 4%. You can choose to stop at any time. And you can choose to lose 3%. You can choose to lose 2%, right? So, uh, the, the problem is 4 boxes is normal. And so you have to size. To use the 4 boxes, right? It's the 4 boxes are a prerequisite, so prepare, you know, anticipate, prepare to use 4 boxes. And I, I'm, it says here risking 1%. I put 1% in the box. I don't make 1% per day. Right, I make maybe 0.3.5% per day. Right, so I'm risking 1% and I make less than 1%. And I keep it because I walk away every day. This is the kind of consistency we're looking for, right? This is, uh, since April 11th. Right, this is 3 months or 2.5 months. 3 pips, 3 pips, 3 pips, 3 pips. This is the worst drawdown I had 2 days ago. And that that worst drawdown on $14,000 was $500. Uh, and so in theory, what we have is a very, very, very high win rate. And we need to keep the high win rate. Because one loss can take away 3 days of work. Right, so our job is to catch the losers before they go to the stop loss. Right, it's not like swing trading. When you do swing trading, you rely on the stop loss to stop the trade. Or you let it go to the take profit. What I do, I let it go to the take profit or I find a solution. Right, the stop loss is the last resort. So for me, the solution is usually average, you know. It's a, yeah, it the the system will work if you have discipline and if you understand why. Leaving the casino is so important. Thank you for watching everyone. uh, if you need to reach out, you can reach out to us on Slack and uh I'll be more than happy to answer all of your queries. The the next best thing to do with this would be to go ahead and calculate a few boxes on your own, so, uh, open your favorite trading platform. Go to your 5 minute chart at your favorite time of day. And measure 10 swings. Average those 10 swings and that will be your baseline for the box and within that box, just look for support and resistance. That you'll see me do this in the videos and it will be uh eye opener. It's, it really is simple once you see it in action.


## 05 1 deciding on the bias aac

So, number one, deciding on the bias. So, basically, uh, the question is, can we walk through, uh, the top-down analysis and how do we go about picking the direction for today? And so, uh, there's a couple of alternatives to this, and depending on where you live, so if you're living in Europe and you're trading the beginning of the European session, it's a fairly new day. You're following the Asian session, which was basically 24 hour candles. And so there's not much on your left. There's not much history on the left, right? When I'm coming in in North America, I'm coming in two sessions before me, right? The Asian session is completed and the European session is still underway, so there's more there to refer to and there's more towards the average daily range. And so I come in for the North American session, I look at the average daily range. And then I can see how much of it is left to do, if any, sometimes we've already exceeded it and so if it's already been exceeded a lot of the top down analysis is a matter of looking for this extension to come to an end, right? It's not going to the moon. And so usually that's a number of boxes it's a number of standard deviations beyond the average daily range, right? So it's not some random number, it's a number of boxes. It's it could be 1, it could be 2, maybe 3, but we're counting boxes, right? So once we see a half of a box we can see the end of the move, right? It's no longer fulfilling. A standard deviation, right? It's giving you a half a box. You can expect the end. And so, you do this idea on the daily chart, right? So you come in on your top-down analysis. First thing you do is look at the daily chart and you're looking to your left. You're comparing the ongoing candle. With the one that's already closed. And you're just looking at structure right which is the higher high, which is the lower low are we making higher highs? Are we making lower highs? right? you're just looking at the simplest stuff and that has you thinking for the next couple of hours, not the whole day. You're not here for the whole day, right? So the top down analysis starts on the daily. And you are comparing today versus yesterday. And right here, right now, the new day is just a few hours old, right? It's barely 5 hours old. And we have done. 18 pips, 2 standard deviations. Out of a potential 87 pips. Right, so where will the remainder come in? Are we gonna be bullish for 87 Pips? Are we gonna be bearish for 87 pips? So that's the first assumption, right? How much of the day is left? And then you look at structurally, which is the probable outcome. Right, so that's step number one, you zoom into this. Current candle on the hourly, right? So now you're looking at it. Intermediate, right? You're looking at it from right now, looking left intraday. So right now, looking left intraday we have the low right here below us, and we have a most recent high 3 bars ago. And so right away we can define risk, right? We know the highest right here, we have to break this to be bullish. And we know there's a floor right in this area here, we have to break this in order to be more bearish, right? Not to the South Pole, but at least temporarily. Right, so it's range bound we've already identified the range and we would play this range based on what we think is supposed to happen on the daily, right? So the daily is where we get the idea. The hourly is where we get. The plan No, so the idea is now a little bit more detailed, you know, if I break this, if I break this, if I stay inside of this, right, so those are the three things I'm worried about. And then I zoom into this. On a 5 minute chart. And then in this environment, I can look to my left. And highlight the area that's been useful to us in the past, right? Stuff like this here. Something like this here. Right, and I'm just leaving clues behind. I'm just looking to see if those past levels. Can be retested again. Right, so I'm just, I'm not using this as a target, nor am I using it as an excuse to put my stop loss. I'm just using it as a call to action. Maybe, maybe I have something to do here like add a trade or remove a trade, right? It's just a decision point. It's, it's a place where your attention needs to be. You know, brought back to the chart, right? So every time you get one of these levels, look here on your 1 minute chart and look to see if it's worth taking extra, right? Is it worth the attempt at making 3 PIPs and the probabilities are yes. Right, so these rung on the ladder that we're creating. Our action points, and one way or another, uh, over time, we revisit these, right? We may be going down the ladder right now. Give it an hour or two, maybe we'll be going back up the ladder. Right, so the latter is really what we have to to look at more like a a road map and we're expecting to do something if and when we get to these these levels. It's like looking at a road map to see the next exit, right, to find the next exit or the next on ramp, right? So this is your road map. And once you have. The destination and the road map, you can actually start driving to get there. And you do this on the one minute chart and you're going to use a box. That is uh. The same as yesterday and the day before and the day before and the day before, right? So we don't reinvent anything. We recycle the tools and we recycle the targets and basically everything else that goes with it. Right, so from a top down standpoint. It's trying to align a couple of things together, right? Uh, the guys, the traders, the professionals that have access to many, many, many, many zeros in their account, those that can actually physically move the market. They're one specific group and they're trading the daily chart. The daily candle close is what they're focusing on, and they're doing it the same way you and I are doing the one minute chart, right? They're waiting for support, they're waiting for resistance, they're waiting for some kind of level that's meaningful to them. We are trying to align ourselves. With that behavior. So we're not fighting. The man with 12 zeros in his account, right? We, we kind of want to ride his coattail. This is where and why the daily is so, so, so important. OK, so if you live in North America, your top down starts on the daily. If you live in Europe. I would recommend you do your top down on the 4 hour chart. Same idea, right, you're comparing the current 4 hour candle. With the one before, which is already closed. Right? And the reason is, you are lacking the history on the left, right? When you're trading in Europe, like I said earlier, you're only looking left to what was the Asia session, 8 hours. When I come in in North America and I look to my left, I'm looking at 16 hours, right? I have a lot more history to lean into. So for those of you in Europe, start your top down on the 4 hour, zoom in on the current candle, compare it with the one before. Look at the structure lower highs, lower lows. Stuff like that, right, and then zoom in on the one hour. Highlight the range. Zoom in on the 5 minute. And highlight the road map that you're expected to follow. Right? Uh, once you have this road map, your time will be spent on the one minute chart, and over here it's just a point of reference, right? It's just looking to see potentially you might be going to, you know, 495. Right? Potentially you might be going to 488, right? Potentially you might be going to 485, right? So we're just looking at the potential and on the left. You're trading the actual facts, right, so top down. Not bottom up, right? Bottom up is what most newer traders find themselves doing. Right, they'll open a trade and then out of curiosity or out of fear, they'll go up into the time frames to find an excuse to stay in that trade. Right, so we're doing it the other way. The reason for top down. is to find the best side of the two, right? You have one over the other, you're trying to pick which one is the better one. And in doing so, You are therefore eliminating. At least 50% of what would have been a mistake. Right, so by picking the right side, you're just simplifying your life for the couple of hours following. That's it. OK, so top down is the first step, and it's an alignment function, right? You're just trying to line yourself up with the potential for the next couple of hours, right? And then, uh, literally, I'm only here for 2 hours each day, and so I'm not really looking very far. I'm only looking until I find something. Right, so typically on the 5 minute chart, I find stuff within the previous 4 hours. Right? So I'm, it's the, the issue would be on the daily chart down here, there's nothing to look at for days, for almost a whole month. Right, that would be extremely scary for us as a very short term day trader. Right? We don't want to be referring to levels that are a month old. My job is to be flat every day, preferably using points of reference that were created, you know, minutes ago. Uh, you can see the two boxes here. These are gaps that remain open. Created 1 week ago and 3 days ago and we're we're trapped between these two gaps, right? So a lot of this stuff we notice we take notes, but day by day I'm trading today compared to yesterday. Is my 2 hours expected to be as or more bullish than yesterday? Is it, is it expected to be as or more bearish than yes, than, than the day before, right? So I'm just trying to align myself with that potential 2 hours and if I don't have clues. I'm, I'm anxious. This is where measuring with our boxes and relying on the probabilities and the statistics is really our, our best tool, right? If we measure this here, this little environment at the bottom, the wick. 83, 84 pips, right? This is our, this is our playground, and we find ourselves. Because of the top down and because of where I am, you know, trading the North American session. I find myself building a wick. On the daily candle and that's kind of what we're attempting to do, right? We're trying to figure out where will the wick be. So if you are doing a top down, which you should. You're trying to align yourself with the intermediate time frame. So if the higher time frame and the intermediate are telling you the same story. It's recycle, recycle, recycle, recycle, and you're done. If one is telling you something and the other is telling you something else, you're probably going to be building a position like we did here, right, layering in, buying on the way down, buy, buy, buy, buy, buy, buy, buy, waiting to find support. To make our money back, right? So the money was postponed. We postponed gratification. This is a function of uh playing the pullback, playing a counter trend move. Right, so we have to see the trend. We have to see where we are when we come in at the right time of day. And finish what I started in this case, it was a 4 box move. 36 Pips to the pip. And off we went in the opposite direction for 3 boxes, 27 pips to the pip. Right, so nothing here is weird. It's just recognizing where we're coming from. And that's exactly what you do on the daily. And what you do on your intermediate time frame, right? So, top down, not bottom up, right? Bottom up is an excuse to stick around a bad trade.


## 06 2 over trading and trade management aac

The the next topic that we needed to cover is uh over trading and trade management so how not to over trade and managing the trades that are left at the end of the session, right, so what options do we have and how do we go about making that decision? And so again, uh, discretion is key, and years and years of practice make that a lot easier, right? In the beginning you need points of reference, you need, you need to see and recognize, you know, oh, the last time I played this, it worked in my favor and if I did the same thing 10 times, it would have worked, you know, 7 of those 10 times. And so when you're approaching it from a Over trading standpoint, you need to approach it from your average day. Right, you're not trying to max out, and you're not trying to do as little as possible, you're trying to do an average inside of your two hour window. And that is a function of the market, right? We cannot create trades that don't exist. And we don't want to, you know, go too heavy on too few trades. Right, so we don't change our size, we just trade what's there. And so in order to not over trade. We must allocate certain amounts of money. Per box and in our case, we start with 1% per box. Ideally you want to break up that 1% into more than just one trade, right? You don't wanna take just one trade and hope for the best. Right, so what we do in order to not over trade, is take that 1% and we break it up into 4, right? So now it's a 0.25% per trade. And if you're trading a 0.25% per trade on the one minute chart. There's a lot of opportunities here. To test support, right, so we've been at this level before. We're testing it once. That's one trade, one assumption, right? So how do I not over trade by counting what I've spent already, right? By keeping track. It's like a budget. Right, and I know I'm only allowed 4 clicks per box. And the thesis tells us if you're. Pushed or propelled into the other box which was not part of the plan we are now allowed another 4 clicks, right? So that's a total of 8 clicks, that's a total of potentially 2% of your account. if you consider this, uh. A methodology that's, you know, trying to get you out of trouble and not one that's trying to get you into trouble, that 2% is a small price to pay to not lose. 36 bits, right, to not lose 2%. It's like the willingness to spend a little bit to save a lot. Right? So this is the idea behind box number 2, and limiting the number of trades you put in box number 2. Again, we're not over trading, we're just spending trades that are allowed to be here. Does that make sense? Right, so ideally you're spreading your risk, you're allowed to spread your risk. You're allocated 1% per box. We just have to see and wait for the proof. In order to take the trade. Right? So if this is the proof here, support right there, right here, we're testing our assumption, right? We're testing is this support, and I'm testing this assumption with now two traits. Again, far, far from over trading, right? This is a 0.5%. And I'm only trying to make 3 pips. So the minute I make that 3 pips. That risk is off the table. And I can choose to walk away or I can choose to put that same amount back to work again. Try and make another 3 pips. I'm recycling my trades, right? I'm not over trading. The over trading comes in once I've met my average. And now I'm either greedy, or I'm looking at the clock, and I say, oh, I have time left. I'll use it to make more money. Right, that's a function of greed. And so if you've met your goal, just walk away. Right? It's not worth the risk of, of blowing or giving back a day's work, right? So over trading is managed. Inside the box or the lack of overtrading is managed inside the box. And what we do is wait. We use discipline and we use a little bit of, it's pre-planning, right? So we're waiting for the edges of the box, we're waiting for proof, we're waiting for a clue. To take that trade, right? So now I have 4 trades all in this one box right here. And if I measure where we're coming from. We are now 16. The 18 tips is right there at the bottom of the box. Right, so that would be a 2 box move. Right, to the pit. Right, so we're willing to play. 2 boxes at least, maybe 3, maybe 4. Again, we're tracking, we're budgeting our clicks. Each one click is worth a 0.25%. And by the time we have layered in something like this, we may have spent up to 16 clicks and that's it that's the limit that we have, right? So it, it's not willy nilly, it's not click to your heart's content, right? It's click because you have the ammunition. And you have a target to shoot at and lo and behold you have the time to do it, right? So if you either run out of bullets or you run out of time. You kinda are stuck, right? And this is why trading as a business, starting on schedule, finishing on schedule, it, it serves multiple purposes, right? It limits the risk and it kind of forces the discipline to not over trade, right? Go work on your tan instead of working on your, you know, your P&L instead of destroying your P&L, right? So in theory, what you have here. What you have here is the ability to predict where you're gonna be spending your money, right? This is what this is. And so before you even get here or here or here. You can plan ahead, right? If we get to this level, I will have spent 2%. If we get to this level, I will have spent 3%. If we get to this level, maybe I wanna quit. Right? So we, we use this roadmap to kind of anticipate what may be, you know, potentially coming our way. And we don't know the future, but this tells us where the past was useful. And so by looking at it from, you know, from this standpoint. We're looking at it into the future. Right, we, we now have identified what the past was. Right, so we're looking at this right here. Right, Bottom of the box. Take a trade. Right, ultimately, we're looking for a bounce. We're looking for something that works in our favor. Right, it doesn't have to be crazy. It it really is a function of. Our ability to stay still, right? We don't have to go crazy and panic and close everything. Uh nothing here calls for this, right? We just found support. And if we measure this 23. 28, there's the end of that move potentially right here, right, that next rung right here. That would give us 3 standard deviations. That's the kind of stuff we think of ahead of time. And here we spend the money in real time. We have the time 2 hours and we have levels to rely on to exploit during that 2 hours, right? So we're using s strategy, we're using, uh, allocated funds, right? So we've spent just 1.25%. To layer in. And now we're gonna sit here and wait to see if that works, right? If we were right in our assumption, right? Are we in the zone to find support here, right? Will this bounce back up, not to the moon, right, but maybe back to resistance. Slash support, right? So is this going to at least bounce a little bit? We're in the right zone and we did not overspend. Right, so that's kind of how you manage your money. Are you, you have to budget the clicks, and each click is maybe 0.25%. Right, and you're limited to the number of clicks. You don't have unlimited money, so we know when to start failing. And at the end of the session, which was the 2nd bullet there, uh, if you traded your 2 hours and you have a handful of trades left open. Couple of things, you know, are, are at your disposal. You could close the trades that are left, book maybe a small loss, and give back some of your profits. Or what I choose to do most of the time is to leave everything as is. Right, I agreed to the stop loss when I took the trade. And I also agreed that, you know, the attempt at making the three Pips. I'm not going to disturb this unless some things change, right? Unless. Proof in the pudding tells me that I've been wrong and I, I should consider getting out. Right, it's the fact that we don't want to make a false move and then make another false move to fix the first false move. Right, so we're using the box to measure the facts and something like this here has us trusting the measurements, right? We don't have to assume it's not risky, right? It it's as risky as uh not trying. Right? It's only 0.05 and it's only a 3-ep target, right? The probability of getting there is 95%, 96, 97%. Is, is it worth not trying? No, right? So what we're left with at the end of the day is maybe a handful of trades that don't need babysitting. Right, the structure was in place when you took the trade. And unless you come really close to this, there's nothing here for you to do, right? So just leave as is. That's kind of what you'll hear me say in our daily sessions, right? Just walk away and don't touch your stops, don't touch your target, right? It's a matter of discipline and the belief in the, the belief in the statistics that you're working with. Right, so the box that you're created that you have created. Came from the market itself, right? You averaged the actual market. And so we're not gonna fight that behavior, we're not gonna. We're not gonna think that the box is wrong, right? When the box actually came from the market, we're just gonna have to make do with what the box is and then within the box we can extract consistent income. 3 to 4 clicks. Each click is the same target. Right, so this is literally in the ejection seats, right? I wish it, it would say ES here instead of SL. Right, because SL has you thinking, I'm just gonna let it come here and stop the loss. No, our job is to stop the loss before it ejects. Right, so we can engineer what we need, i.e., based on average moves and average pullbacks, we can target an average outcome. And it's doesn't have to cost you an arm and a leg, right? You can do so with a handful of trades all of the same size. All looking for one consistent outcome. Right, so Uh This is kind of the idea behind the not over trading, right? You start with limits, and then you work within your limits. Our limit is 4 boxes or 4 standard deviation. And each standard deviation is allotted 1% of your account. We hope That we don't spend the 4% to make money, right? We're hoping to just spend 1%. And recycle it, right? I'm hoping I find the bounce that I'm looking for and things go my way. Right, I'm kind of hoping I can make money here. Without having to go beyond 4 or $5 of drawdown, like 1 pip of drawdown. Across 5 trees. And that's, I, I'm not gonna complain with that. Right, so the over trading is up to us to exercise discipline. The next question was managing the leftover trades. That's the other part, right? Each day is a little bit different from the day before, so you may want to close your trades, you may wanna leave them as is, or you may want to just reassess things, but typically you don't touch anything. Trade number 4, the trading strategy under different market conditions. So how to trade when the predicted direction is right so that's the recycling, recycling, recycling, and the main job when the bias is correct. So that's basically what we did over here when the bias is working in our favor we just open one trade, open the next trade, open the next trade we keep. Not chasing the market, but exploiting what the market has to give. And we kind of have an idea by measuring where we're coming from, how much of this we can expect before we come to a halt, right? In this case, it was 2 boxes. Right, so we moved up 2 boxes and came back. This was what, 4 boxes? 3 boxes, 2 de Pip. Right, so a lot of this stuff is just a measured move. It doesn't, it's not presented like it. We have to decipher it. Predicted outcome, you want to recycle, recycle, recycle, and then when things go against you. So that may be part of the plan, which it was this morning. Right, the trend was bullish, and the market that I walked into. At the 8 o'clock in the morning, was bearish at the time, so bearish in a bullish market. I use this as an opportunity to buy buy buy. Measuring where I was coming from at 8 o'clock, we'd already moved two boxes, so I bought first trade. And that first trade made us 3 pips. I bought it again, so I recycled and made the same money again. Right, so eventually the market pulled against me. I'm buying, the market keeps falling. And so this is me layering in 1 box, 2 boxes, right? So by the time we built this. We had 2 boxes layered in postponed gratification and ultimately we got paid about an hour later. Right, so we, we layered in and got paid an hour later, repeated the same scenario and got paid again. Right? So it's rinse, wash, repeat, rinse, wash, repeat. It's either recycle, recycle, recycle, or exploit, draw down, exploit, drawdown, exploit, drawdown, and eventually get paid out. Right, so it's either you're making your money immediately because you're bouncing directly into your target. Or you're not bouncing, right, so your assumption is failing. But instead of giving up, you keep it open and you try again, try again, try again, try again. Ultimately you have 16 chances. And the 16 chances are not random throws of darts, right? You have to look left, you have to find resistance, you have to find support, you have to find an excuse to expect a bounce. And the bounce is what makes us money. Right, so it's one or the other, in some cases, it's one and the other, like this here this morning. Right, so that's here nowhere did I take a cell trade. Like every single trade here is a buy buy buy. Whether it's working in my favor, or building a drawdown, you know, building a position that will eventually pay me out. Right, so it's this not chasing the market but instead expecting the current move to come to an end, right, so the current move that I walked into was eventually going to come to an end. It did at 36 pips. I happened to walk in at 18 pips. And I figured, OK, it's gonna bounce by 36, and I don't know where it's going to bounce. So I'm gonna try here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, right? So I keep on trying, and when I find what the market is looking for, We make our money. Right, so the strategy is to either recycle when things are working favorably. Or depending on what the next move calls for, you may be layering in. And waiting to get paid. And still, everything here is in line with the trend. Right, we're not trying to fight the trend. We're making higher highs. We're making higher lows. We're just operating in this environment. Right, so by not Counter trend trading. When the big move comes along. I'm not threatened by it, right? This would have actually worked in my favor. Right, so ultimately I don't want to fight the trend. I'm not trying to trade it, but I want it to support me, right? I want it to help whatever it is I'm trying to get into. All right, so when things go our way, we have two choices. When things don't go our way, right, so let's say we had our bias bullish, and the market came 5 boxes instead of 4. That 4th box. Or sorry, that 5th box from the top. It is not the 4th box with trades in it, right? It's 4 units of measure, but only 2 units of measure have money. That would be a clue. That, hey, this might be a trend that's unfolding, right? It's more than 4 boxes. We don't want to keep adding money to this. Right, so when things don't work our way. The priority becomes breaking even, right? You're now engineering and exits. You're now going to spend money. In order to lose less. Right, so if you don't average out and you just let it be. Odds are it's gonna come down here and take you out. Right, so why not get in the way? Why not interfere? Why not spend 5 microlos. To save 36 pips. Right, so this is kind of what we do here. Right, if we go into box number 2. It's because box number one did not work. And we have to fix it. And we're fixing it using box number 2 and the money that maybe. Allocated there right we have to wait to see the facts we have to wait to see how the market presents itself right but we're willing to do it and that's the difference right? we're willing to sit on draw down while we're trying to fix it, work in progress, right? It's not a loss. these trades are referred to as work in programs. And so we're gonna keep him. Working As long as we can right up to PIP 35, right? And then PIP 36 belongs to the market, but right up to PIP 35 that trade belongs to me and I'm gonna try and get it to 3 PIPs or to get it less than a 36 PI loss, right? So the choice is mine when the market chooses to reverse on you, we have to accept the fact. And do the necessary deed right? so for some of us that may be booking a loss until you figure out the skills necessary to, you know, work it out and that's what we're here for, right? By averaging in we have the luxury of also averaging back out. And reducing the losses or at least engineering a less dramatic loss. So that's what we're trying to do. We're not trying to make a million dollars, we're trying to not lose what we started with. And we can do that by spreading our money. Instead of throwing one dart and hoping for the best. Right, so it's the spreading of that risk that makes you a winner in the end. Would you not rather have 4 chances to be right per box instead of 1 chance per box? All right, so, right away, your odds of being right go up. And so, if we want to be right and successful. Two separate things, we need to lower the bar so that being right can actually pay us. Right, cause being right and still not making any money, uh, doesn't make sense, so. At some point you find that equilibrium, it could be on the 1 minute chart, maybe you prefer to trade the 15 minute chart, right? There's a box there too. There's a bounce waiting to happen on the 15 minute chart, and you can profit from it there as well. Same, same, same thesis, right? So it works, you make money, it goes into drawdown, you engineer to make money. And if it goes backwards, so opposite to your bias, not just a pullback, but an actual reversal. We have to Choose to lose, right? There's just no other way. Uh, hedging sounds good, but it's not a solution. OK, so get that out of your mind. Uh, the next topic, learning resources and video or documents. So yeah, the, a lot of the stuff that I've recorded, you guys already have access to. Uh, another thing that we may, or if you want to spend some time googling. Look at uh Brownian motion. Especially Brownian motion in finance is, is what it's called. Brownian motion in finance. This is what we're doing, but we're doing it here. Right, we're exploiting this left hand side. You, you guys are swing traders are used to trying to profit from here, right? And so I kind of gave up that and I found myself operating over here where the probabilities of success are a lot higher. Right, so Google Brownian motion and go down that rabbit hole. The next thing you may want to investigate and you know, maybe uh dig into because it applies to any instrument out there and it applies to any time frame out there, right, which basically is our price and time cycle. Right, go down this rabbit hole, right? It's called the Bayes theorem. You can find this on YouTube, a bazillion videos we'll talk about this, really common sense stuff, not complicated at all, but it, it's the backbone for what we're doing. Right, and it really highlights the function of the bell curve and how it fits into the market. Right, so, uh, time is a function of that bell curve, right? Time is also a function of your chart. And so we're trying to find a way to kind of blend time and price. And so Brownian motion. And Bayes' theorem are the two basis for this, uh, for this theory, uh for this thesis. Uh, the other thing you probably want to have a handle on, which applies again to any market, any time frame, are these core patterns and our axioms. And so, uh, the axioms are the rules that go along the core patterns. It doesn't matter what you're trading, you know, it will follow this, this set of rules and it will follow these core patterns. All we did is calculate from history what this little box looks like. And then we're using this little box in conjunctions with the core patterns and the rules. And ultimately what we end up with is a bunch of little boxes that are stacked up on top of each other. And it leads to maybe the next move. Right, so one leads to the other, which leads to the other, which leads back to number one. Rinse, wash, repeat, rinse, wash, repeat, rinse, wash, repeat over and over and over and over so maybe you're coming in today near the low of the day and you're going to build a wick on the daily candle maybe you're coming in near the high of the day. And you're gonna build the wick on the daily candle. Maybe you're trading the European session and you're building the body of the candle. Right, these patterns are there all day every day. You just gotta figure out where you are. In the big scheme of things. And so for us doing the top down analysis. We do the top like this. And then we do the intermediate like this. And then we end up trading the one minute chart. With our little box. Right, so we have to figure out this, we have to figure out if it's a push or a pullback, and then we have to create the facts, right? But it's, it's one answer that leads to the next answer that leads to the next answer. Hopefully it leads you to the best side. Therefore, you can ignore the low probability. Right, so these core patterns, these axioms kind of force you. To trade the next move. Instead of chasing what's happening right now in front of you. Right, so, uh, I'm sure we've all. Been stuck at the top or been stuck at the very bottom holding the bag. Well this is how you avoid that, right? Plan for the next trade instead of the current one. Number 6 documents, the environment, yeah, I think we have a folder already. I think Alex put something together for this, and then, uh, the last part here that he has, uh, the second last is special days. For us in particular, it's a priority that we avoid trading the news, right? So, one specific style of trading is news trading. And it's clearly not what I'm trying to do, right? I'm trying to mitigate that kind of risk by looking at the calendar ahead of time. And kind of expecting. An outcome one way or the other, I don't really care. I just, I expect a move because of a catalyst and so I wait for the catalyst, right? So we wait for the news NFP FOMC we don't plan for it we don't schedule we don't, we don't forecast the outcome, right? So we stand aside if we can if we don't have any open trades, just stand aside. Let it come out, let it move 100 pips, and then wherever it ends up, that's where we start trading, right? Just like the market here fell 36 pips and it stopped, right, it stopped falling and here we are trading when it stopped falling, right? We did not trade to fall, although we could have, but you know we. Took trades at the end, even at the end of this nine bit move. Right, so it's this idea that you, you can control, you can discipline, you can. You don't have to rush into things, right? Wait for the price to come to your level, wait for that support either the edge of the box or support that you've highlighted. Right, before you throw in a trade, right before you jump the gun. And typically, if you're patient enough and you are buying on a red candle. You're buying just in time for the bounce, right? Just in time for the red to turn green again, right? Just like that, boom, right there. Right, so if this is truly support right here. This will bounce and hopefully into my target. Odds are it'll probably take more than a couple of bars because each bar is only one pip. Right, you can see that here. Right, so if my target is 3 peps, I need to wait at least 3 minutes to get there. So that's the kind of stuff, right? We see the news, we know the news will increase volatility. We don't want anything to do with the actual news release, but we're more than happy to take a part of the outcome, right? Uh, think of yourself as an ambulance chaser, and we're just here to clean up the mess. Right, so in reality, you have a lot more control than you think, and because you have those 16 clicks at your disposal, you don't have to be afraid of, you know, getting stuck. Speaking of which. If you have trades already open going into the news events. A couple of things you can do, right? You can raise your stops, right? So from 36, maybe bring them up to 18, right? 2 boxes. Or just flat out close the trade. Right. Me personally, I tend to close my eyes and hope for the best. I just let the news come out, and then if it's really a disaster, I'm going to take a loss. Odds are, it will fit within my standard deviations, and I'll be able to solve it. Right, so I'm really not afraid of having trades open going into the news because I've kind of grown out of it. I've grown out of that fear. The best you can do is avoid the news altogether. I just show up five minutes after, and this is why we begin trading at the top of the hour, 10 o'clock Eastern. And not the bottom of the hour when the stock exchange opens, right? We don't want to trade the opening of the stock exchange. Wait a few minutes. In our case, we're waiting for the options expiry. Once that's taken care of, so at 8:01, 8:02 or 1001, 10:02 Eastern time, the evils are known, right? We know what we're up against. we can now get the ball rolling and this is when I start my day, right? You can see that back here we start on schedule. After the news has come out, so this is the news right there. The news came out and by the time we came to the computer, the news kind of settled, right? It's no longer these big crazy bars. We're back to normal size bars with normal expectations. Right, so it's a matter of sitting still and not chasing this carrot that you'll never catch. Right, if your intent is to trade the news, there's ways to do just that. And you can do so with the calendar a year in advance, right? You can plan your trades. You don't have to be. Afraid of the news. Just be aware. Right, that it's, it's a catalyst and in our methodology, we don't like these kinds of catalysts, right? We don't like these kinds of moves. Right, we prefer stuff that's sideways, stuff that's measured, predictable, or at least, you know, anticipated, right? Stuff like this right there out of the blue for whatever ungodly reason, we, we don't want that unless it's in our favor. Right, so we use time of day to filter this out, right? And then the last and final question that was submitted was the mindset for this particular strategy. That's a very good question. We could talk hours and hours on the mindset. uh, the best thing to think of is your local insurance company, right? Look and think of how much they hate. To lose money, right? How much do they hate to pay you for a claim? When you submit a claim, right? They will send out an adjuster, right? They will look at every angle possible to deny you that loss. Right, we have to operate with the same mindset. Right, this is why we have an allocation of 4%. But we're not hoping to use the 4% to make money. Right, we're hoping to use 1%. To make maybe 0.25% that day. Right, if I make a 3% that day. I'm golden, right? I'm not trying to beat the bank at its own game. I just want to be averaged. Over the course of 4 or 5 days in a row. Right? And if I can do that, the mindset takes a huge breather. I no longer am I trying to make ends meet because I have bills due. I just do what I know I can do, almost with my eyes closed. And if I can do it like a business on schedule. You can almost write down the rules. It's like working at McDonald's, your first day on the job, you have your employee guidebook. Everything you need to know is in that is in that guidebook. Right, this is what's happening here, right? We're learning to operate within the guidebook and, you know, you will get fired. At PI 36, right? So if you want to keep your job, don't let it go there, right? Close it before it gets there. And that's the kind of the psychology we have to have, right? Think of your trading account or your prop account as a newborn baby. And you, I'm sure, will do just about anything for that newborn baby, including booking a loss if it's necessary. Right, so you don't have to lose the $6000 on a $100,000 account or whatever the limits are. You just have to structure to operate within. Right, so, for example, you rent $100,000 they limit your losses to $5000. You are therefore operating a $5000 account, right? Operate within that $5000 bubble that they give you. And so maybe cut that in half, and so you can have yourself two bad days in a row. Uh, here we are, we've closed all of our trades, we made a little bit of money. It's taking about an hour, you know, it's, well, it's taken 20 minutes for this, but we've been, you know, going over the, the thesis for about an hour. And so in theory, what you have is a lot of control and the ability to kind of choose uh. The style of trading, you know, and not necessarily. the trouble you're willing to get into, right, the style of trading does not equate. The trouble you're gonna get into. Right, so it's just money management and risk management. If you're a swing trader, your focus is on a risk to reward ratio that must be positive. And I moved away from that mindset. And I'm focused on probabilities. And so for me to take a trade, there has to be a probability of making 3 Pips first and foremost, and that usually stems from support or resistance. Right, so if I have that criteria met, it's very, very likely that I will take a trade. And so right away. I'm taking risk. I, I'm breaking out of this here, hopefully. Right? Hopefully we're breaking out of this and so I'm testing for the break. It's very rare, right? Usually I'd be selling the resistance, but I don't want to sell. I, I'm, I wanna be buying this bottom here and so I'm buying the brake, and if I'm right, we'll make the 3 pips on the way to making 9 pips. Right, so the psychology is I'm not trying to hit it out of the park. I'm just trying to get myself to 1st base and then maybe 2nd base and then maybe 3rd base and then if I can do that, you know, 5 or 6 times per day. I've done more than enough. Right, so the psychology is reverse. It's the flip side of the coin, right? When everybody is trying to blow the doors off their own statistics, we're just trying to stay in the groove, right? We're just trying to be boring, steady as she goes. The 4 boxes give you the freedom. To come out with average results, right? Average good, average bad, average. This is the key, right? It's average. We're not looking for superhero stuff. Everybody that tries to be the superhero ends up, uh, you know, with very different outcomes, OK, so this basically it we have probably a couple more recordings to do to to go over the boxes, but, uh, that's it.


## 07 3 boxes aac

Today's topic will be number 3 on the list, uh, boxes and their creation, their measurements, and why we would want to be, uh, using the boxes. And from the topics that were submitted, uh, number 1 and number 4 are clearly asking for the same information. So we're gonna touch on that together, and then we'll look at how we use the boxes and the reasoning, uh, why we would want to use. Uh, the boxes may be differently under different circumstances, right? So first and foremost, uh, why the box and how would we go about measuring it? So, let me bring in my whiteboard and one of the first thing I wanna touch on is a specific rabbit hole that you may wanna find yourself going down over time. And it's called the Brownian motion in finance. And so there's Brownian motion pretty much everywhere in life, uh, you know, in science, in physics, and chemistry, uh, and finance, uh, it's a matter of narrowing down the focus and extracting, uh, consistency from what looks to be chaotic. Right? So we take this input, this data, and we filter it, we somehow extract from this chaos, something that is somewhat consistent. And over time, you can see it building this um Bay theorem. I it, it Bayes, it builds a, a bell curve, and the bell curve clearly points to high probability. In this case, events, right? So we're hoping to be able to target something similar to this and protect ourselves from the extremes, from the events that don't happen very often. Right, so if we can see the data input as not so random but contained within these extremes we can extract and find what is standard within this input and then once we know what is standard we can start to target it as a means of making money instead of hoping for something bigger or something unachievable. We can start looking at. Reaching something that is uh highly, highly, highly probable. Right, so now instead of having a 2 to 1 risk to reward ratio that may or may not work, we have an inverted risk to reward ratio that has a better than 95% chance of working out because we're targeting this stuff right there and trying to mitigate if we slip away from the peak, right? So the more standard deviations we are faced with. The more of a job we have to do, right? We have to kinda adapt to the slipping away from the mean right so eventually we do expect a reversion back to the average and so we try to operate within, within that that uh that range, right? So that would be Brownian motion and finance it's the beginning of what we do here, right? So it's the root cause for this price and time cycle. That we try to uh extract from the market, right? So whether you're bullish or bearish doesn't really matter, right? The data is aggregated uh the same way and we account for it the same way, right? We don't care if it's a bullish move or a bearish move, we'll tabulate it as a move, right? So by the time we're done, we will have created this bell curve, right? And we'll do so by following. This second slide here. OK, so in order to move forward, uh, you're gonna need pen and paper. Uh this is my journal. This is what I use for journaling. It fits in my shirt pocket, right? Tiny little book. Uh, you're gonna need something like this and basically tabulate price and the price action for your two-hour window, and you want to do so maybe for a month's worth of data. Right, so if you show up every day for 20 days in a row, you're gonna be doing this, uh, this manual labor for, for about a month. Once you've done it, you don't have to repeat, uh, unless you want to verify, but, uh, the box doesn't change, so you can reuse the same box once you've got it figured out, right? So what we need to do, using the price action on the real chart. Is something like you see represented here. We're gonna have to go back in the past and measure the average moves that were there, preferably in our Time window our our expected business hours right so if I'm hoping to trade the same day, the same time every day, I want to measure that time in particular, maybe a little bit before and a little bit after to make sure I encompass my business hours right? so I'm gonna have to go back on the price chart every day and measure in the history. A few of the moves that were there around my business window. And then average those moves as we see here, right? So in real life, we will be averaging pips. Right, pips and the number of bars. And in real life, we will be doing this work on a 5 minute chart. Right, so we're gonna be measuring basically the price and the time cycles on the 5 minute chart of the Euro USD and trying to figure out what is an average move on a 5 minute chart, right? So we're trying to figure out what is an average move and in order to get to this average move we're gonna have to calculate how many. Standard deviations are, are, are used during our uh our 2 hour window, right? So we need to go back and average this 2 hour window over the course of time to get a, a more accurate, uh, reading, right? Just one sample, one day is a good starting point, but it's not accurate enough. And if you measure, you know, a year's worth, it's probably too much, right? It's a waste of effort and so something better than 10 days and less than 30 days would be adequate, right? More than 30 is, you know, a waste of effort. You just, you, you need a good enough sample. We don't need the perfect sample, right? So keep that in mind we're not here for perfection, right? We're just trying to figure out. A probability assessment right? what is the likelihood that today's moves reflect somewhat yesterday's environment right? so we're not trying to recreate the world we're just trying to repeat or kind of uh redo the same thing over and over and over, right? It's represented up here. Right, we're not trying to change much. We're just trying to repeat a cycle of some kind, right? There may be a tilt to this, right, we may be trying to go up, but it's cyclical in nature and once we understand the rhythm, we can appreciate the X axis as as uh input to our to our system, right? We use time of day and time in general as an input. Right, so let's go to the real price action. Let's go to the real charts, the trading platform, and we can measure a couple of days' worth of swings and create this, this representation here. We can create from real data what the box would look like, uh, as we started today. Right, so today was the NFB. We don't want to measure this. This is a one of a kind, kind of a move so we could probably start yesterday and for example, maybe we chose to operate uh GMT time from 1600 hours to 1800 hours. That would be, uh, I believe 10 o'clock Eastern time. Right, so if I choose to trade every day between 10 and 12 Eastern time. I would have to go back and measure. Before and after that window pretty much every day. I just wanna make sure I encompass this window in my measurement, right? So I need to go, I'll, I'll go back to the right here and we need to measure and write down on a piece of paper with a pen, you know. Stuff and we have to measure maybe 10 swings, you know, 2 or 3 before 2 or 3 after and uh move on to the day the the next day, OK? So you can see here on the chart I put on this is MT5 by the way, so I put on zigzag indicator it comes built into the platform under the examples here. Uh, you can choose to put it on, or you can choose to do this manually. It's up to you. This just simplifies trying to figure out what the swings are. Right, so with the zigzag indicator, it highlights the swings. And with the ruler on your trading platform, you need to go and measure these swings. And so in order to access the ruler, um, in this platform, I just press the wheel on my mouse. And the crosshairs come up, right? So if I press the left button on the crosshairs and hold the button down, I'm now in control of the ruler. And I can measure that swing right here. This swing in particular was 28 bars long. And it says here 21.2 pips. Right, so I need to tabulate this, I need to write down. the number of bars and the number of pips for that particular swing. Right, so in this case, we have, uh, let's say 25 and 21. OK, so 25 bars. 25 bars, 21 pips. Then I measure this swing here. Right, 5 bars, 26 5s, 5 bars, 26 5s. We measure the next one. Right, so we do this for a dozen or so. 12 and 38, do this one back here, this is a big one. So now 27, 28 bars and 65 pips, 2728 bars, 65 pips and then we're faced with a few smaller mos, right? So we'll measure these as well 4 and 14. And we need maybe 5 or 6 more. Alright, so 10 and 15. And then if we repeat this process day in, day out. Uh, this is the same one, this one. Uh, 9 and 13, 9, 13, 1234567. I'm at 7. This is number 8, 12 and 25. Number 9. This will be 11 and 22, and then we'll finish with this last one back here. Uh, 4 and 13. OK. So, this is one day of samples, about 12 measurements, right? We've tabulated them, we, we know the number of bars, the number of pips. We now have to add that up, right? So now you add up the two columns. And both columns, you will divide by the number of swings that you've calculated, right? So by the time we do this calculation, so let me uh pull up my calculator here. That'll take 30 seconds. Unlock Calculator. And so that gives me 242. And I have 123456789, 10 samples. So that gives me 24 pips on average. OK, 24.2 pips on average. Through the 10 samples. Now, let's do the same thing with time, 120, 120, and I took 10 measurements, so that means 12 bars across. And so now we know. Right? From averaging the measurements that we took, we're looking for an average swing. 12 bars long. And it should, on average, give us 24 PIPs on average, right? So if I bring back my, uh my whiteboard, what we've calculated is the price and the time cycle. To be for that one day on average, 24 pips. And 12 bars. Right, so we've averaged the, the real life price action to be 24 pips for 123 standard deviations. So divide this by 3. And we have the time 123. Standard deviations, and we want to divide that by 3 also. Right, so now, because we're dividing it by 3, we're assuming perfection. Give yourself one extra. So now you end up with 4 standard deviations you end up with this right here. And so ideally, we start from Pip zero. And we will find our way up to PIP 24. And once in a while we may end up having to use one extra standard deviation. But on average, on one day, one day only, we already know we're looking in real life. I know my real life box is 27 and my one day of measurements is telling me 24. I'm already pretty darn close. Right, so from experience I know that this one day of measurements, those 10 swings are putting me in the ballpark. I, I'm already in the vicinity of what I'm looking for, right? So if I repeat this exercise for the next 10 days or so and average tomorrow with today. And so on and so on and so forth. So you have a rolling average of about 20 days of data. You're gonna find the box will eventually settle on 12 bars. And uh basically 27 pips. 27 pips for the top and 12 bars for the top. OK, so now measuring the live price action on a 5 minute chart for about a month at the same time every day you end up with a standard move that is extracted from the market. That is 12 bars long, 12 5 minute bars. So the average move from the market is already 60 minutes. And it delivers on average 27 pips. In the 60 minutes. So that's kind of the basis for. Uh, where we want to be extracting that consistency, right? We know the market is able to deliver this because we calculated it from the market, right? The market told us this is what it does. With or without news events and with or without catalysts, the facts are this. And so we can take this and reverse engineer to a one minute chart, right? So, zoom in to this. Using a one minute chart. Right, so instead of only 12 bars in our box, we end up with 60 bars in the box and the box does not change in height, right? It's still the same amount of of pips, right? So we figured out the length of the box, but now we're looking at the entire deviation, right? You have to break this down. Into 3. Right, so we'll take the box, divide by 3. Gives us 9 Right, and then if we add an extra one just for the margin of error because we don't wanna, you know, get thrown off. The bell curve, right? We want to be kind of employing the top of the bell curve for our efforts. Uh 9 pips. 60 bars becomes what we want to, you know, operate with over time, right? So if you add today's data with yesterday's data and the day before and the day before and the day before, over time the box will settle on 27 and 12. And then if you, you know, break that down from a price and time cycle into a standard deviation, you just need to divide by 3 and, and add 1. OK? So, basically, it's trying to stay within the bell curve. We're trying to figure out the bell curve itself and how can I stay inside? How can I avoid this piece right there? This right there, I don't want to have anything to do with it, right? This is too risky. And once I'm down here, I, I'm having a really tough time going back up. Right, so this I have a chance, this. It tends to go that way and only that way, right? So I need to allow for this piece right there. But not this. OK, so this is where we get the 3 standard deviations plus 1. I plus plus the right. The right shoulder. We don't wanna have anything here. OK, so we allow ourselves. The freedom to kind of waffle on both sides of the mean, right? We're willing to operate a little bit extra. Even though we know that on average, things should be less. Right, so on average, we've seen this day in day out now. Our average moves are 2 to 32 to 3 boxes. And once in a while, we must use a 4th box. Right, and then we know from facts if we tend to go into box number 5, there's usually no coming back. Right, so by not allowing box number 5 and just kind of having their resolve to stick to 36 bit or less. We will lose a few trades at 37 pips. But it's not enough to destroy the account, right? The majority of what we do fits within the model. And it's the odd, the very odd trade that will get taken out right there. And that's something we have to learn to live with, OK, so it's like a brand new car, you can't stop the hail storm. Right, so your brand new car will not remain brand new forever. This is what we expect, right? We expect the market to represent. Itself in a similar fashion day in day out, unless there's a catalyst. Right, so we measure the facts, right, so if we were to go to the day before. Repeat the process, right? Measure a couple of swings after your 2 hour window. Make sure you account for your 2 hour window and make sure you count a few swings before the 2 hour window, right? So basically you wanna, you wanna encompass your 2 hour window. Uh, as I was saying, we, we need to account for more than just one day of data, right? Our, our one sample, or one day sample gave us a box that is in the proximity. Of what we're looking for, right? It gave us a close enough box, it gave us a box to start with, and the more data you collect over the course of a month or so, uh, you'll end up settling on the box that is, uh, uh, appropriate for the market you're looking at. Right, so you can see from this example, it doesn't matter what market you choose, right, this could be NQ, it could be the euro pound, it could be the oil market. If there's data on the left you can average the data you can create a average move from the markets itself so you're not extracting something from thin air, you know you're calculating the actual moves and averaging them over time and therefore, much like looking out of the window, you're expecting to see something consistently. Right, so similar moves day in day out and understanding where the not so similar moves take place around news events we can then avoid them right instead of getting stuck or trapped or confronted by a news event we can see the calendar and avoid this mayhem right? we can aim for consistency instead of aiming for home runs. Right? So it really is a function of extracting the facts, right, averaging the facts. And over time, the average resembles. Real life a lot better than just a one day sample, right? So you, you measure the swings, you average the swings, you now have a price and time cycle, you divide that number that you have by 3 and that will give you the left side of your bell curve. Uh, where's my whiteboard right here, right, so in our case for today, we calculated 24. Right there and so we know 123 standard deviations from 1 day sample is 24 pips and the same 1 day sample told us 123 standard deviations was 12 bars. Right? And then we want to allow for a 4th standard deviation, just in case, right? So you need to take this divided by 3. And then add one more, right? So same thing here divided by 3 and add 1 more right so that's just to make sure we have room for error. We want to be able to allow the market to do more than average and still not screw us over. Right, so we're expecting an average, but we're willing to accept a little bit more and that's kind of uh the where the 36 pips comes from, right? We expect 27. But we allow for 36. And we don't allow 37, right? This, anything beyond this is not allowed. Right, so on purpose and so once we have the box calculated and once we have an average we can, you know, rely on to start with, it's only gonna get better from day one, right? Once you average day one with day two, the box may or may not change that much, right? Over the course of a month of data, the box may or may not change that much. It may just. Get a little bit more accurate, you know, uh, less fluctuations, more consistent, which is kind of what we're looking for. OK? So now that you have your box, you have your trading platform, we can remove the zigzag indicator. Once you've created the box, once you've collected your measurements, you wanna get rid of the zigzag indicator. And you wanna make sure you show up on schedule. You wanna make sure you show up at your on your one minute chart. And inside of that 2 hour window. You're going to create the standard deviation, one standard deviation from the price and time cycle that you've created, that you've calculated, right? So we've already calculated our price and time cycle. Right, and we've created a box to match, so let's say this is the box, you know, 60. By 9 Come on. There we go. There's the 9 pips and we're looking for 60 bars across. There's the 60, so this is the box. This is one standard deviation from the price and time cycle we've calculated and so in order to use this on schedule, right, so I come to work here. I don't know the future yet right so the box is actually here. And we don't know what's about to come next, but we know the past and so we can use the past as a as a point of reference. The most recent swing would be adequate if you're not sure, you know, if you, if, if you're not sure if it's a bullish or bearish, if you're not sure if it's just sideways. Start a few swings back and measure the facts that are there. Keep stacking the boxes. Right, so by stacking, I mean you put the box on the swing. In this case, swing high. And it broke the box right there, so we stack it. Right here. Right? So we start the new box on the brake, and literally, the move was 2 standard deviations before retracing 1 standard deviation. Right, so now if this is a pullback, we want to reset the box. On the swing and now measure from this brake. Right, so now we can anticipate. 2 standard deviation. Maybe a 3rd 1. Right, so we don't know the future yet, but we're anticipating. By putting the box on the brake and then watching the price, oh come back into the lower box, it came to the middle. It did not come all the way back to the bottom, right, so it failed to give us a standard move. It's continuing in the bullish direction. Right, so by failing to go one way, it's attempting to go the other way. The clues are in front of us, right? Same, same here by failing to go to the bottom of the box, it's spending its it's time at the top of the box. Right, ultimately. Everything flipped. Right? Ultimately, the top box failed to fulfill the top. And instead we spent our time in the lower half. And then it rolled over. And collapsed. Here's the the difference between the box and just a nine Pip grid. Right, the end of the box. The end of the box comes with a call to action, right? At this moment in time, or at this moment in time. We have to assume. Something must be happening. Uh, in order for us to make a decision, right, it's a, it's a, it's like a call to action. And in this case, the upper box, we failed to reach the end of the box, right? We, we came out of the box way before. If we went into it here. We came out of it with. 24 minutes remaining, right? So unused time. The unused time is a clue. Right? The fact that we did not waste the time in the box, instead, the market used that time to give us pips instead. See the amount of time spent? The amount of time not spent. Gave us pips instead. Right, so a unit of measure, and then with that unit of measure. Standard from the market itself you can now assume this may have been a high because we failed to fulfill the box. And reset the boxes. And so now we're resetting to capture. To swing, we're trying to measure real life. In real time. Right, so we're measuring the swings as the swings are evolving. Stacking the boxes from one break to the next break. Eventually, we find a bounce and whatever reason the market had to bounce here, it made reference to somewhere on the left. Right, so if we look to our left. There's a reason why we bounced off of here. OK. Support slash resistance maybe? All right, maybe we found support. What was resistance was support today. Right, so this is the kind of stuff and on the way to finding support, the market distributed for standard deviations. Right, so we can measure the facts. 2 Support or resistance and then once we're off of support or resistance we measure the facts again right so now we start from the swing low. And we measure the next move or at least wait for the price to. Tell you how to measure the next move right so as the price is evolving we keep stacking more boxes. Ultimately it failed to reach the top, right, it did not reach the top of the box. And came back down. And so that allows us to reset the box again. Right, so now we're measuring from here. And we want to catch the break, which took place right there. We failed to meet the bottom of the box. Right here, failed to meet the bottom of the box. So that allows us to think that hey, this may be a low, and so we want to reset the box on that low. And catch the break to the top. Falls break in this case, right? We don't know it's a fals break until it turns out to be a fals break. Oh, and there's a real break. Right, so the box allows you in real time. To stay focused with blinders on, right? If you remove the boxes. You may suspect a bounce. But you won't know what it's capable of, right? You don't know what the potential from that bounce might be with the box, the potential is one standard deviation first and foremost before you get another. Right, and then before you get another. So on and so forth, right? So ultimately this is like a cat and mouse, right? You're just trying to fulfill the box, uh, you're, you're watching the price fulfill the box and when it stops to do just that, you have a reaction to that or you, you have a plan to the market failing to do something. Right, so we use the box to create plan A. How do we make money consistently? And we also use the same box to engineer plan B, CD, right, to engineer the exits. If plan A does not work. And so, what is Plan A? We're trying to make money from within the box, right? So if we suspect a bounce is coming, maybe in this zone here. A bounce would be a high probability trade, considering it's a measured move. The probability is not all the way back to the moon, but instead, all the way back to the opposite side of the box, right, one standard deviation. And the first leg in in in that direction, the first bar. Can be yours to keep. Right, so you don't have to even aim for the entire cycle. We aim for just a small piece of it. And the ability to recycle this is where we, we extract, you know, the money that we're looking for. It's, it's not one trade, one outcome, but it's the average of many trades for a two hour window. That gives us an average outcome for that day. Right? So it's the average work that, you know, within my 2 hour window, I have an average number of boxes, an average number of trades. I have a potential average yield. And it's not something I created, it's something the market told me was there. I just Extract what's capable, what's there to be extracted if I aim for more, I tend to be uh overdoing it, right? I tend to if I, if I aim for more than what the market is capable of, I end up over trading and then creating an environment that I can't get out of. If I start earlier than my 2 hour window, it's a similar quandary, it's a similar problem. Some of the trades that were prior to my 2 hour window may become a problem after the 2 hour window, right? So if I start earlier. I may be cheating myself from a potentially good day. It's best if I just stay disciplined and start on schedule with my boxes on the most recent swing, right? So at 8 o'clock, the most recent swing was clearly right here. At 8 o'clock we would have been stacking to see where we are led to. We were led to this top box and so we would have started at the red line in the upper box knowing we had already moved up to. And the half boxes. Right, so it's knowing where we're coming from, gives us a pretty good clue of what we're capable of still, or yet. And if it's not happening, what should we do now, right? So if it's not going to the top of the box. What should we do now? Right, so it's the ability to flip flop your mind, not necessarily your traits. Right, we don't want to be changing our bias multiple times per day. In my 2 hour window. I don't want to be playing ping and Pong. I would rather play ping ping ping or pong pong pong and be done with it. Right, so the fact that we measure the life as it's unfolding. Eventually you're led to a 3rd or 4th, or maybe a, you know, 3.5 boxes. Or exactly 4 boxes to the pip. No questions asked. You know what to do here, right? This is standard moves upon standard moves unfolding in a standard way. There's nothing abnormal here. Abnormal would have been going into box number 5 from this swing high. That going into box number 5 would have cost us trades from box number 1. Right, but it's an unlikely event, not zero, but low probability, right? So this is the reason for the box, right? Without the box, if I remove the boxes. Your brain does not know. That this is an average move and it's allowed. Right, your brain sees something like this in the making. And says, oh my God, it's going to the South Pole. I'm so screwed. But in reality, if you measure it in real life, you can remain, you know, thinking clearly without panic, without stress, without having to feel like you're threatened. Because the market is behaving normally. Right. Abnormally is where we jump out of our skin, right, this is where we have a job to do, right? Box number 5 comes with a call to action. Right, so understanding the next plan, the next. Move is where our salvation is, right? If plan A is not working, we must switch to plan B. Plan B in our case is box number 2. And switching to box number 2 is something the market does on our behalf, right? It takes us there, the market. Takes you into drawdown, you're now. At least 9 pips away from where you were originally, right? So the ability to measure where you're coming from, like, you know, the speedometer in your car, or the odometer in your car. Right, it gives you a pretty good idea how much further you may have to go. Especially when we take into account on schedule, the average daily range that I'm working within. At my start time. Right, so I have my expected number of boxes for an average move. I have an expected number of pips for an average day. How many boxes is an average day? And how many boxes do I have left to fulfill for today, right, considering I am the last session of 3. Right, so in North America, we will be closing the daily candle, just like we did, you know, uh. Just like we did here today, and that, uh, you know, the move from today off of support did not go to the moon, but instead it went to resistance. And if we measure this. Uh, lo and behold, 27 pips, right? 3 boxes exactly. Nothing abnormal, nothing scary, nothing weird, just something to recognize this is OK and you know, learn to live with within this. And because a range trader looks for support and looks for resistance for an excuse to take a trade, this environment right here, this marching market. This is a beautiful, beautiful environment for us and this is exact this is a dream setup right off of support directly into resistance, no questions asked. Uh, easiest trade of the day was the last trade of the day, right? And then we don't typically see this, right? This is not an average day for us. Our average would have been spent on schedule. And even on schedule, moves can be bigger than average and yet made up. Of average moves. Right, so we're just taking, we're trying to figure out what is an average move which we've calculated and we're using this mathematic num the this this this outcome, this output we're using it every day as a filter uh as a a lens to see the the market through, right? So we're not trying to expect something. That would not fit this little box, right? It has to fit this box if it, if it's outside the box, if it's abnormal, it's a call to action for you and I where everybody else is kinda hoping for something outside the box we're hoping for something to stay in the box. And then when we start stacking the boxes. We are automatically into fix it mode, right, when the boxes are stacking upon each other. It's, it's creating a trend. It's not clearly bouncing. Uh, it's, it's a situation where you and I have to figure out how to get out of that. And this is where standard moves come in, right? Even this move here from the news event. Right, the move as a result of the news events. It was a measured move, right? The, the news event itself was 45 pips or so. 5 boxes Right, so nothing abnormal, just the speed of which it came at us was ridiculous, right? It came all at once, boom. No time here to stack the boxes, no time here to do what we would normally do in the sideways market. Clearly you don't want to have to be faced with this. And lucky for us, this is on the calendar, right? A year in advance. And when we show up on schedule, we would have shown up, you know, after the fact, trading. Uh, like an ambulance chaser, right? Just cleaning up the mess, trading what's what's there after the news. A lot, a lot less anxiety, a lot less stress, right? And what we have to figure out is average moves. Make up everything. And if I show up on schedule and I show up with my average yardstick. I can now expect to make up something for my 2 hour window, something. With this average move, right? So it's either stacking or unstacking from what was there before. If I show up. At no, at 8 a.m. or 10 o'clock Eastern and there's 54 PIPs done already and we know the day is 60, where are those, you know, 6 missing PIPs going to come from? If at all Right, there's nothing, there's no guarantee that says we have to fulfill the ADR. Much like there's no guarantee that says we have to stop at the ADR right? Clearly today we did way more than the average. I think the average was 72 and I think we did uh. 87 Right, so, uh, a couple of boxes extra, right? That's the only way to move this set average. Uh, otherwise it's a, it's a straight line, right? If you don't do more or don't do less than the average, you don't have an average. And so, uh, understanding the box and how we use the box to consider averages, you know, is this normal? is this abnormal? That's how we stay safe that's how we protect ourselves from ourselves. Right, because, uh, if you take away the box, your brain will see this and have you thinking this is going straight to the moon, and your brain will have you buying up at the top there out of fear of missing on something huge, not taking the time to look left to see that buying. At the top is a stupid idea. So by measuring your way there, you can see this is a stupid idea. Right, so you don't have to necessarily look to the left, you can measure from the left. You can measure where you're coming from. You can expect or anticipate if the future is even possible. Right, so, uh, the alternative is to hope for the best. I would rather just, you know, shoot for something that I know is, is there. And if I shoot for something slightly under what is consistently there, I'm more than likely going to get it over and over and over and over and over. Right, so we lower the bar. So that the bar fits inside the box, right, we lowered our target. The target is inside the box. And because we now respect the market and the fact that it moves 3 to 4 boxes at a time. We've raised our standards. To not allow trades in box number 5, the, the question comes up all the time. Why not 1/5 box, you know, why not a 6th box? You, you basically have to put a line in the sand and commit, you know, if you choose 40 pips, you choose 40 pips, but next week you can't allow 42. Right, so if, if you settle on one number, settle on that number forever. I settled on 36 pips and so now I, I refuse to lose more than 36. It doesn't say how many trades I lose at 36. It's just they, they stop at 36, right? So raise your standards. So that you don't lose at random anymore, you lose the same or less. And uh by the same token, lower the bar so that the bar is achievable. Repeatable right consistently and then by doing the same stuff over and over and over using the same box over and over and over and over the law of large number takes hold, right? You're just now repeating, you're adding to your sample, you know, your 20 year career is going to be made up of, you know, 2 million trades. You have to start with trade number one, right? So as long as you don't change your your behavior. Uh, The consistency comes out of the woodwork, you know, it, it's by definition, your, your targets are always the same, your stops are the same, your boxes are the same, nothing changes. You are the last variable. And because of a little bit of structure and a few guidelines, you can have a consistent behavior. Right, so in order to pull out of the market. Approach the market from a winning standpoint, you know, not from a fear, but from a, you know, I'm gonna win no matter what I kind of ideal and uh figure a solution to the problem. The box lets you sort out a solution. The box lets you budget your clicks before you need to spend them. Right, the box lets you envision the future before the market goes there, right? And how many trades will I take to get to this level? Right, and where would the trades be potentially, right? You can look to your left and start to align the boxes and maybe potential future trades with past price action. Right, so the kind of stuff we do is just to, to ease the anxiety. It's a lot simpler if you have a, a job to do after this job, right? So if you're not left wondering what to do next. And the worst thing to do as a trader. Is to not have a plan, right, not have your next move figured out. All I'm teaching you guys to do with the boxes is to think of your next move. Before you're forced into it, right? So, the current move, whatever is happening right here, right now, it's happening inside the box. It's a standard move, which we're hoping to extract. Not the entire move, right, but we're extracting from. And the way you stacked the box. Is an assumption. Right, so we're assuming this is a low down here. And so we're stacking our boxes from that low. It's just an assumption, and I may be totally wrong. And, you know, I have to reset the boxes. I have to readjust or you know, re-gauge the situation. That's fine, right? 1234, and a little bit, right? The market is. The machine that it is, it's a sole purpose is to fill pending orders. Uh, we're trying to figure out where the probabilities of pending orders being. Here, right? What, what are the odds of having pending orders at this level right here? Considering it's 4 standard deviations, extremely high, right? That's it, that's all it is, it's just an assumption and on the way to that assumption we can make money. Right, so the bias is a piece, it's not the holy grail, right? The trend is a piece, it's not the holy grail, the box is not the holy grail, right? It's just a standard move. It's a move that's represented all day every day. We're just trying to figure out how can we exploit it. So that's basically how to create the box, how do we go about moving the box. The reasons for the box is to, you know, keep your head on square because otherwise, your brain will run amok, right? If you remove the boxes, your, your brain is looking for a qualifier, your brain is looking for a reason for this thing to be moving. The box kind of contains the price and now your brain has a reason to think it has to break one of the three sides, hence you have a call to action right so right away anxiety kinda lifts, right, because you, you're thinking about your next move instead of wondering if the next move is even coming. Right, so I would rather have 3 plans. And wait to see which plan I need to use. Instead of not having a plan at all. And hoping for the best. Right, so, uh, when it comes to the box, right, we have to remember it comes from the market, right? The market tells us this is how much it moves, this is how much money it it carries with it. Right? Potential average yield, and our job is to extract it, or at least an average, uh, consistently. I hope that answers most of the questions.


## 08 4 tading under different market conditions aac

Trade number 4, the trading strategy under different market conditions. So how to trade when the predicted direction is right. So that's the recycling, recycling, recycling, and the main job when the bias is correct. So that's basically what we did over here when the bias is working in our favor, we just open one trade, open the next trade, open the next trade we keep. Not chasing the market, but exploiting what the market has to give. And we kind of have an idea by measuring where we're coming from, how much of this we can expect before we come to a halt, right? In this case it was two boxes. Right, so we moved up 2 boxes and came back. This was what, 4 boxes? 3 boxes, 2 de Pip. Right? So a lot of this stuff is just a measured move. It doesn't, it's not presented like it. We have to decipher it. Predicted outcome, you want to recycle, recycle, recycle, and then when things go against you. So that may be part of the plan, which it was this morning. Right, the trend was bullish, and the market that I walked into. At the 8 o'clock in the morning, was bearish at the time, so bearish in a bullish market. I use this as an opportunity to buy, buy, buy. Measuring where I was coming from at 8 o'clock, we'd already moved two boxes, so I bought first trade. And that first trade made us 3 pips. I bought it again, so I recycled and made the same money again. Right, so eventually the market pulled against me. I'm buying, the market keeps falling. And so this is me layering in 1 box, 2 boxes, right? So by the time we built this. We had 2 boxes layered in postponed gratification, and ultimately we got paid about an hour later. Right, so we, we layered in and got paid an hour later, repeated the same scenario and got paid again. Right? So it's rinse, wash, repeat, rinse, wash, repeat. It's either recycle, recycle, recycle, or exploit, draw down, exploit, drawdown, exploit drawdown, and eventually get paid out. Right, so it's either you're making your money immediately because you're bouncing directly into your target. Or you're not bouncing, right, so your assumption is failing. But instead of giving up, you keep it open and you try again, try again, try again, try again. Ultimately you have 16 chances. And the 16 chances are not random throws of darts, right? You have to look left, you have to find resistance, you have to find support, you have to find an excuse to expect a bounce. And the bounce is what makes us money. Right, so it's one or the other, in some cases, it's one and the other, like this here this morning. Right, so that's here, nowhere did I take a cell trade. Like every single trade here is a buy buy buy. Whether it's working in my favor, or building a drawdown, you know, building a position that will eventually pay me out. Right, so it's this not chasing the market but instead expecting the current move to come to an end, right, so the current move that I walked into was eventually going to come to an end. It did at 36 pips. I happened to walk in at 18 pips. And I figured, OK, it's gonna bounce by 36, and I don't know where it's going to bounce. So I'm gonna try here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, right? So I keep on trying, and when I find what the market is looking for, We make our money. Right, so the strategy is to either recycle when things are working favorably. Or depending on what the next move calls for, you may be layering in. And waiting to get paid. And still, everything here is in line with the trend. Right, we're not trying to fight the trend. We're making higher highs, we're making higher lows. We're just operating in this environment. Right, so by not Counter trend trading. When the big move comes along. I'm not threatened by it, right? This would have actually worked in my favor. Right, so ultimately I don't want to fight the trend. I'm not trying to trade it, but I want it to support me, right? I want it to help whatever it is I'm trying to get into. All right, so when things go our way, we have two choices. When things don't go our way, right? So let's say we had our bias, bullish. And the market came 5 boxes instead of 4. That 4th box. Or sorry, that 5th box from the top. It is not the 4th box with trades in it, right? It's 4 units of measure, but only 2 units of measure have money. That would be a clue. That, hey, this might be a trend that's unfolding, right? It's more than 4 boxes. We don't want to keep adding money to this. Right, so when things don't work our way. The priority becomes breaking even, right? You're now engineering and exits. You're now going to spend money. In order to lose less. Right, so if you don't average out and you just let it be. Odds are it's gonna come down here and take you out. Right, so why not get in the way? Why not interfere? Why not spend 5 microlots. To save 36 pips. Right, so this is kind of what we do here. Right, if we go into box number 2. It's because box number one did not work. And we have to fix it. And we're fixing it using box number 2 and the money that maybe. Allocated there right we have to wait to see the facts we have to wait to see how the market presents itself right but we're willing to do it and that's the difference right? we're willing to sit on draw down while we're trying to fix it, work in progress, right? It's not a loss. these trades are referred to as work in programs. And so we're gonna keep him. Working As long as we can right up to PIP 35, right? And then PIP 36 belongs to the market, but right up to PIP 35 that trade belongs to me and I'm gonna try and get it to 3 PIPs or to get it less than a 36 PI loss, right? So the choice is mine when the market chooses to reverse on you, we have to accept the fact. And do the necessary deed right? So for some of us that may be booking a loss until you figure out the skills necessary to, you know, work it out and that's what we're here for, right? By averaging in we have the luxury of also averaging back out. And reducing the losses or at least engineering a less dramatic loss. So that's what we're trying to do. We're not trying to make a million dollars, we're trying to not lose what we started with. And we can do that by spreading our money. Instead of throwing one dart and hoping for the best. Right, so it's the spreading of that risk that makes you a winner in the end. Would you not rather have 4 chances to be right per box instead of 1 chance per box? All right, so, right away, your odds of being right go up. And so, if we want to be right and successful. Two separate things, we need to lower the bar so that being right can actually pay us. Right, cause being right and still not making any money, uh, doesn't make sense, so. At some point you find that equilibrium, it could be on the 1 minute chart, maybe you prefer to trade the 15 minute chart, right? There's a box there too. There's a bounce waiting to happen on the 15 minute chart, and you can profit from it there as well. Same, same, same thesis, right? So it works, you make money, it goes into drawdown, you engineer to make money. And if it goes backwards, so opposite to your bias, not just a pullback, but an actual reversal. We have to Choose to lose, right? There's just no other way. Uh, hedging sounds good, but it's not a solution. OK, so get that out of your mind.


## 09 5 learning resources aac

The next topic, learning resources and video or documents. So yeah, a lot of the stuff that I've recorded, you guys already have access to. Uh, another thing that we may, or if you want to spend some time googling. Look at uh Brownian motion. Especially Brownian motion in finance is, is what it's called. Brownian motion in finance. This is what we're doing, but we're doing it here. Right, we're exploiting this left hand side. You, you guys are swing traders are used to trying to profit from here, right? And so I kind of gave up that and I found myself operating over here where the probabilities of success are a lot higher. Right, so Google Brownian motion and go down that rabbit hole. The next thing you may want to investigate and you know, maybe, uh, dig into because it applies to any instrument out there and it applies to any time frame out there, right, which basically is our price and time cycle. Right, go down this rabbit hole, right? It's called the Bayes theorem. You can find this on YouTube, a bazillion videos we'll talk about this really common sense stuff, not complicated at all, but it, it's the backbone for what we're doing. Right, and it really highlights the function of the bell curve and how it fits into the market. Right, so, uh, time is a function of that bell curve, right? Time is also a function of your chart. And so we're trying to find a way to kind of blend time and price. And so Brownian motion. And Bayes' theorem are the two basis for this, uh, for this theory, uh for this thesis. Uh, the other thing you probably want to have a handle on which applies again to any market, any time frame, are these core patterns and our axioms. And so, uh, the axioms are the rules that go along the core patterns. It doesn't matter what you're trading, you know, it will follow this, this set of rules and it will follow these core patterns. All we did is calculate from history what this little box looks like. And then we're using this little box in conjunctions with the core patterns and the rules. And ultimately what we end up with is a bunch of little boxes that are stacked up on top of each other. And it leads to maybe the next move. Right, so one leads to the other, which leads to the other, which leads back to number one. Rinse wash repeat rinse, wash, repeat, rinse, wash repeat over and over and over and over so maybe you're coming in today near the low of the day and you're going to build a wick on the daily candle maybe you're coming in near the high of the day. And you're gonna build the wick on the daily candle. Maybe you're trading the European session and you're building the body of the candle. Right? These patterns are there all day every day. You just got to figure out where you are in the big scheme of things. And so for us doing the top-down analysis, We do the top like this. And then we do the intermediate like this. And then we end up trading the one minute chart. With our little box. Right, so we have to figure out this, we have to figure out if it's a push or a pull back, and then we have to create the facts, right? But it's, it's one answer that leads to the next answer that leads to the next answer. Hopefully it leads you to the best side. Therefore, you can ignore the low probability. Right, so these core patterns, these axioms kind of force you. To trade the next move. Instead of chasing what's happening right now in front of you. Right, so, uh, I'm sure we've all. Been stuck at the top or been stuck at the very bottom holding the bag. Well, this is how you avoid that, right? Plan for the next trade instead of the current one.


## 10 6 special days news trading aac

And then, uh, the last part here that he has, uh, the second last is special days. For us in particular, it's a priority that we avoid trading the news, right? So one specific style of trading is news trading. And it's clearly not what I'm trying to do, right? I'm trying to mitigate that kind of risk by looking at the calendar ahead of time. And kind of expecting. An outcome one way or the other I don't really care. I just, I expect a move because of a catalyst and so I wait for the catalyst, right? So we wait for the news NFP FOMC we don't plan for it we don't schedule we don't, we don't forecast the outcome, right? So we stand aside if we can if we don't have any open trades, just stand aside. Let it come out, let it move 100 pips, and then wherever it ends up, that's where we start trading, right? Just like the market here fell 36 pips and it stopped, right? It stopped falling and here we are trading when it stopped falling, right? We did not trade to fall, although we could have, but you know we. Took trades at the end, even at the end of this nine bit move. Right, so it's this idea that you, you can control, you can discipline, you can. You don't have to rush into things, right? Wait for the price to come to your level, wait for that support either the edge of the box or support that you've highlighted. Right, before you throw in a trade, right before you jump the gun. And typically, if you're patient enough and you are buying on a red candle. You're buying just in time for the bounce, right? Just in time for the red to turn green again, right? Just like that, boom, right there. Right, so if this is truly support right here. This will bounce and hopefully into my target. Odds are it'll probably take more than a couple of bars because each bar is only one pip. Right, you can see that here. Right, so if my target is 3 peps, I need to wait at least 3 minutes to get there. So that's the kind of stuff, right, we see the news, we know the news will increase volatility. We don't want anything to do with the actual news release, but we're more than happy to take a part of the outcome, right? Uh, think of yourself as an ambulance chaser, and we're just here to clean up the mess, right? So in reality you have a lot more control than you think and because you have those 16 clicks at your disposal, you don't have to be afraid of, you know, getting stuckpeaking of which. If you have trades already open going into the news events. A couple of things you can do, right? You can raise your stops, right? So from 36, maybe bring them up to 18, right? 2 boxes. Or just flat out close the trade. Right, me personally, I tend to close my eyes and hope for the best. I just let the news come out, and then if it's really a disaster, I'm going to take a loss. Odds are, it will fit within my standard deviations, and I'll be able to solve it. Right, so I'm really not afraid of having trades open going into the news because I've kind of grown out of it. I've grown out of that fear. The best you can do is avoid the news altogether. I just show up five minutes after, and this is why we begin trading at the top of the hour, 10 o'clock Eastern. And not the bottom of the hour when the stock exchange opens, right? We don't want to trade the opening of the stock exchange. Wait a few minutes. In our case, we're waiting for the options expiry. Once that's taken care of, so at 8:01, 8:02 or 1001, 10:02 Eastern time, the evils are known, right? We know what we're up against. We can now get the ball rolling and this is when I start my day, right? You can see that back here we start on schedule. After the news has come out, so this is the news right there. The news came out and by the time we came to the computer, the news kind of settled, right? It's no longer these big crazy bars. We're back to normal size bars with normal expectations. Right, so it's a matter of sitting still and not chasing this carrot that you'll never catch. Right, if your intent is to trade the news, there's ways to do just that. And you can do so with the calendar a year in advance, right? You can plan your trades. You don't have to be. Afraid of the news. Just be aware, right, that it's, it's a catalyst and in our methodology, we don't like these kinds of catalysts, right? We don't like these kinds of moves. Right, we prefer stuff that's sideways, stuff that's measured, predictable, or at least, you know, anticipated, right? Stuff like this right there out of the blue for whatever ungodly reason we, we don't want that unless it's in our favor, right? So we use time of day to filter this out.


## 11 7 mindset of the scalper aac

And final question that was submitted was the mindset for this particular strategy. That's a very good question. We could talk hours and hours on the mindset uh the best thing to think of is your local insurance company, right? Look and think of how much they hate to lose money, right? How much do they hate to pay you for a claim. When you submit a claim, right? They will send out an adjuster, right? They will look at every angle possible to deny you that loss. Right, we have to operate with the same mindset. Right, this is why we have an allocation of 4%. But we're not hoping to use the 4% to make money. Right, we're hoping to use 1%. To make maybe 0.25% that day. Right, if I make a 3% that day. I'm golden, right? I'm not trying to beat the bank at its own game. I just want to be averaged. Over the course of 4 or 5 days in a row. Right? And if I can do that, the mindset takes a huge breather. I no longer am I trying to make ends meet because I have bills due. I just do what I know I can do, almost with my eyes closed. And if I can do it like a business on schedule. You can almost write down the rules. It's like working at McDonald's, your first day on the job, you have your employee guidebook. Everything you need to know is in that is in that guidebook. Right, this is what's happening here, right? We're learning to operate within the guidebook and you know, you will get fired. At PI 36, right? So if you want to keep your job, don't let it go there, right? Close it before it gets there. And that's the kind of the psychology we have to have, right? Think of your trading account or your prop account as a newborn baby. And you, I'm sure, will do just about anything for that newborn baby, including booking a loss if it's necessary. Right, so you don't have to lose the $6000 on a $100,000 account or whatever the limits are. You just have to structure to operate within. Right, so, for example, you rent $100,000 they limit your losses to $5000. You are therefore operating a $5000 account, right? Operate within that $5000 bubble that they give you. And so maybe cut that in half, and so you can have yourself two bad days in a row. Uh, here we are, we've closed all of our trades, we made a little bit of money. It's taking about an hour, you know, it's, well, it's taken 20 minutes for this, but we've been, you know, going over the, the thesis for about an hour. And so in theory, what you have is a lot of control and the ability to kind of choose uh. The style of trading, you know, and not necessarily. the trouble you're willing to get into, right, the style of trading does not equate. The trouble you're gonna get into. Right, so it's just money management and risk management. If you're a swing trader, your focus is on a risk to reward ratio that must be positive. And I moved away from that mindset. And I'm focused on probabilities. And so for me to take a trade, there has to be a probability of making 3Is first and foremost, and that usually stems from support or resistance. Right, so if I have that criteria met, it's very, very likely that I will take a trade. And so right away. I'm taking risk. I, I'm breaking out of this here, hopefully. Right? Hopefully we're breaking out of this and so I'm testing for the break. It's very rare, right? Usually I'd be selling the resistance, but I don't want to sell. I, I'm, I wanna be buying this bottom here and so I'm buying the brake, and if I'm right, we'll make the 3 pips on the way to making 9 pips. Right, so the psychology is I'm not trying to hit it out of the park. I'm just trying to get myself to 1st base and then maybe 2nd base and then maybe 3rd base and then if I can do that, you know, 5 or 6 times per day. I've done more than enough. Right, so the psychology is reverse. It's the flip side of the coin, right, when everybody is trying to blow the doors off their own statistics, we're just trying to stay in the groove, right? We're just trying to be boring, steady as she goes. The 4 boxes give you the freedom. To come out with average results, right? Average good, average bad, average. This is the key, right? It's average. We're not looking for superhero stuff. Everybody that tries to be the superhero ends up, uh, you know, with very different outcomes. OK, so this basically it we have probably a couple more recordings to do to to go over the boxes, but uh that's it.


## 12 2025 Januarry - DrawDown Managemement at end of Session aac

All right, I see everybody joining slowly. Hello and welcome everyone to um today's 6th monthly scalping mastery call. Um, today we are going to be talking about um drawdown management at end of session, and before I pass the torch to uh Jean Francois, um, just a little reminder, um, just like on Riverside, please, if you have any questions, type them in the chat box, and Jean Francois will monitor that and get to your question as soon as he can. All right, over to you now. It's awesome. Good morning, good afternoon, good evening, everyone. Uh, it is the 22nd of January, 10 o'clock, uh, Eastern time, 9 o'clock in the mountains. Uh, we're looking at the charts, but I'm not gonna be trading all that much, right? We're gonna be talking more about uh how we handle our leftover trades, typically at the end of our trading session, because we've run out of time. Right? So, keeping an eye on the clock puts a art stop to our trading session, and that's for risk management, right? It's not because we're, uh, it's not because we're lazy or no, we're not, we're not mindful of what's forthcoming. Right? We may have met our goal already, right? And uh maybe you have 2 or 3 trades left over, and instead of, you know, booking a loss and walking away, you're wondering if you should just leave them open, right? So when it comes to risk, there's only 4 things you can do with it. And because you're already in that trade, it limits some of the things that you can do with it, right? You can transfer risk. You can reduce the risk. No, you can start booking losses by transferring that would be, uh, you know, maybe looking at hedging. You know, putting some of the risk on the opposite side, right? You can take some of the drawdown off the chart, right, remove some of the losses, and if you're going to take that route, you have to start booking the worst losers first. Right? The ones that are going to get worser. Right, so you book off, you, you take off your biggest loss. And you leave behind the smaller losses to give them hope, right? Or you can just accept the trades as is, which is what I typically try to do, right? I've already accepted the 365. When I took the trade, right? I was willing to put that amount at risk. And so I tend to just walk away when the time is up, right? So, you can transfer the risk, you can reduce some of it and give time for the other trades to play out. You can just accept everything as is, like you did originally when you took the trade. Or you can just avoid over trading, right? So you keep an eye on your clock, and you know, you're gonna eventually run out of time. So you don't try and push it right up to the limit, like I've been doing the last couple of days, because we're committed to a 2 hour session, right? So, in those 2 hour sessions, like yesterday, we did meet our goal within the first hour, but I kept on trading so we can have a full 2 hour together. I would have been wise to just walk away after meeting the goal. Right? So the idea of this risk management approach is how you would manage any type of risk. It doesn't matter if it's equity or sto uh or, you know, futures, anything, anything that's tradable has to have this type of approach with it, right? You have to have a plan. When you get in, When the trade is underway. And what you're going to do in order to get out. And if you go and check on the Slack group, uh, in today's uh daily accountability folder, one of our traders, Nick C, posted his method for overnight, how he got himself out of trouble, right? He basically reduced his risk, and he bought himself a couple of extra boxes in doing so. All right? So he, he did some of this stuff. Right, maybe unknowingly. Right? But that's, that's what was taking place. And uh he ended up coming out at break even, right? So instead of booking losses and hoping for the best, he managed his risk, right? So if we look over here, oops, sorry, if we look to this platform. I'm gonna take a long, I'm gonna take a short. I'm gonna remove the targets that I have. I'm gonna remove the stop losses that I have. And we're gonna go about our our hour of talking, and then in within the hour. The market will have picked a direction, the market will have moved, and near the end of our trading session, we'll have uh a we'll have trades remaining, right? We'll have Trouble on our hands. We can have a topic of discussion then, right? We'll, we'll figure out how to deal with it near the end of the day, right? So the, the, the whole point is to have the ability to Think one move ahead and see the potential of that one move, right? What is that one move capable of? And so in order to figure out that next move, You have to understand where the current move is heading and where it's likely coming to an end or a pause. Right? So, every day we do this top-down analysis. In order to eliminate one of the two sides, right? We're trying to pick the better side. We're trying to eliminate the less likely side. So right away you're managing risk from the top. Right? So we're looking at the daily. Managing risk, trying to avoid a low probability outcome. So, we're trying to figure out if it's going from the bottom left to the top right, or from the top left to the bottom right. Right? So in this case, we're looking at a bullish chart, clearly, right? So the risk is on the opposite side, right? The risk is on the south side. If things go down, we're in trouble, but you can measure what down looks like on average. Right? So by looking to the left, you can anticipate what an average down leg would look like. And so if you happen to be buying right now, and the market decides, oh, it's time for a pullback. The average pullback is what you're willing to participate in, right? That would be our 4 boxes. And if you're going to, you know, reduce risk to buy more boxes, it's because you're expecting this to be somewhat bigger than average. Maybe it's Donald J. Trump. Right? Maybe there's a reason for bigger than average moves. Right, so risk management comes from all sides, right? Time. Your own approach to risk, your own, you know, what you perceive to be risky to you, right? Maybe you're in favor of what's happening, right? Maybe you feel compelled to take advantage of some of this volatility, right? Uh, consider volatility speed, right? You have to manage that also. Maybe you're the kind of trader that needs a very volatile market. Or you're more like me, you need more time to think things through. Right? And so, hence the boxes, right? We're managing risk one step at a time, but every step has something to do with risk, right? The boxes. Are from the market, not from thin air, right? It's market data that created the box. So already we accept the risk is Right here. It's Bayes' theorem. We have to, we have to average the past. To understand what the potential in the future lies, right? Where to understand what we, we can gather in the next leg, right? So, the risk. Oops, the risk we have to deal with. is when things are bigger than average, right? So we're expecting to play here. And then when things are bigger, We have to eventually cut it off, right? Because if it goes bigger and bigger and bigger, This is way too much money for us. We don't want to have anything to do here. While we can still maybe See PI 35 come back our way, right? Maybe because it's the top of the bell curve. Maybe we're lucky. Right? So this, this 4th box right there, right? This being box #1, box number 2, box number 3, this 4th box, let me remove some of this junk. The 4th box is the one we have to see as The ejection seat, right? So when you're clicking your mouse, you're accepting that this is the worst case scenario for that particular click. Right, you're giving it all of this space. To make 3 pips. Right? You, you took a trade right there, and if it goes backwards, 36 pips, you're in trouble. But if it goes forward, 3 pips, you made money. And you can take trades anywhere here. And expect to make 3 5s. Right? It's when we come here, we don't want to have anything to do, right? We want to, we don't want to be here. The probability of success is slipping away. We, we We are now going against our top-down probability. Right, there has to be a reason for this. There has to be a clue, right? Maybe a news event came out and it propelled you against your bias. That's the risk that we face. That's the ejection seat at work, right? We don't want to be moving the ejection seat each and every day. We want to commit to some number, right? So raising our personal standards. In our case, we raised it. To 36 pips. Right, so we're willing to lose, but not 37. Only 36. And once in a while, maybe you have an election. And you see potential volatility, right? So why not cut your size in half? And double your risk, right? Do your stop loss, I mean, right? So your risk stays the same, right? The same amount of money is at risk. And that may buy you a bigger bell curve, right? Where you're now trading a 72 pip stop loss, and each little click is worth a lot less money. In the end, you're risking the same amount of money. Right? So, understanding what's happening and the potential for that next move, right, is what we have to anticipate. Right? Most people are trying to chase the current move. And so their risk is based Uh, On some Uh, what's the word? I don't want to use the word illusion, but somebody that, you know, Attempts to play this right there to the south side. is because they're chasing this, this, this, this, this, right? It's fear of missing out. They see it, they see it going down. They've been told I'm a trend trader. It's going down, I must sell. And they're disregarding what's happening here, what happened in the past, right? They're just following this, this fear of missing out has them selling. Just when the market is maybe testing support. And market is getting ready to bounce. And because we have a little bit more statistics to back us up, a few more data points, we can see this maybe being an average move. And so our risk is allocated to an average move, right? This is the whole point of this exercise, right? For, for you folks, new traders coming to this methodology. Please, please, please, please, please, go and do the legwork, right? Go and measure the boxes for your own psychology. You have to see it for yourself. You have to reverse engineer the box for yourself. You have to see where it comes from. In order to appreciate how to manage risk with it, right? It's a unit of measure. It's the unit of measure that belongs to this time frame. Right, this instrument, this time frame, it will have its own box. If you pick a different instrument at different time frame, you will have your own box. And if, better yet, if you pick the same time of day to trade every day, the box becomes impeccable, right? It doesn't have to be perfect. Impeccable meaning it gets the job done. I don't need anything else, right? I don't need indicators, I don't need stars, I don't need the perfect scent in the room, you know, I just need this box. Right, it's impeccable. It, it gets me in and out of trouble. Right, it's just a measuring device. It's the right unit of measure. OK, so with the right unit of measure, I can now allocate my risk. Right, 4 standard deviation. And if everything is working in my favor. I'm trading the actual trend. Maybe this will turn into 56789, 10 boxes. That's kind of what happened to us yesterday. And then eventually we had a pullback and then we ended up adding more boxes to the top. Right? And so, this environment, the fact that we've moved from box 4 to into box 5 and into box 6. Clearly is not a pullback, right? An average pullback is 4 boxes. So if we move, if we transition from the 4th into the 5th, Immediately the light bulb should come on that says trend, right? You're now trading the trend. The potential that this is just an oversized pullback is slim. Right? It's slim, it's a low probability. Right? Unless you know the environment that you're in, like in the election cycle or something like that, right? So you have to be aware of the outside world, having an impact on your base theorem, on your price and time cycle, right? So by averaging time, right, the number of bars. We're not only now trying to maximize. Our pips, but we're trying to make best use of the two-hour window that we have, right? Because we know if we go past lunchtime in New York, this cycle starts to look like this. And now trying to make money here is useless. Right? And then if we're trying to start in the European session, your cycle looks like this. Right? So when you're trading the European start of the session, you're typically going to expect, uh, you're typically going to be faced with the trend, right? It's the euro. And it's the European session. They're driving the bus, it's their currency. Right? And so when I come along in the US session, The European traders are heading out. The risk. is heading out the door. Right, that's kind of the way I see it, right? The people driving the bus have done their job for the day. The ADR, the average daily range, is typically near complete, so there's not much left for us to do in North America, right? So I'm, I'm envisioning my risk, and I'm seeing it slowly dwindling away. Right? So in my mind, I'm not faced with increasing volatility, it's the US traders. I'm faced with decreasing volatility. I'm faced with a risk that is decreasing. Right? Hey, Nikos. And so, uh, in theory, what I have access to is a little bit of history to help me guide a little bit of the future. But the further into the future I look, the more unlikely. I'm going to be right, right, the more, the more wrong I'm probably going to be. It's like forecasting the weather. Right? If I try to look out the window, I know exactly what clothes to wear. But if I try to figure out what to wear tomorrow afternoon, I have no clue. Right? So, understanding the risk we're faced right now. Has a lot to do with where we come from. And before we click our mouse, we have to figure out exactly. Where we're coming from and where the end of that current move is likely going to be, right? Likely going to be. And so we can use our boxes in the real world, we would be stacking boxes. Right, 3 to 4 boxes. And then boom, it goes. Right? And then, and also in the real world, if you don't favor the one minute chart, you can repeat this entire exercise on any time frame. Right? The risk will clearly be Bigger, because your boxes will be worth a lot more money. Right? Each box, if you give yourself 4 standard deviation, and 1 standard deviation on the hourly chart is 18 pips. Right? Or if you're trading the 4 hour chart, one box on the 4 hour chart is 36 pips. Right, so if you're trading those higher time frames, you are taking on more, uh, I don't want to say more risk, but the probability of not being right, right? 4 hours is a long time. For something to happen. Right, you can measure. We 4 hours. You can measure a 4 hour box, you can take a trade, and then it may take you, you know, a day, a day and a half to get across the box, right? So the psychology has to be able to support the risk. Right? That's why I'm not a position trader, and I can't hold on to stuff for weeks at a time. Right? So, risk is in every aspect. And how do we manage it at the end of our trading session? Well, let's go take a look. We're still waiting, right? We're still undetermined. If this right now was the end of my trading session. And I was, uh, you know, long, for example, I was in trouble on the long side of the equation. I already have some long trades open up here. Uh, In this particular account, I think I'm floating, yeah, right there. Right, so I'm already long, I'm already in drawdown, right? I can manage this environment. By offsetting the risk, right? Offset would be the hedge, right? If I'm already long 0.6, and I have one short already, I can add 55 to this and make it even. Zero risk, right? So if I add 55 shorts, let's go, uh, I could do it right here. I'll do a cell limit. No, actually, never mind, never mind. I'll do a cell stop. So stop. And we'll fix it to 55. And now It will be hedged. At 55, oops. If I get triggered in here, I'll have the same amount of longs as I do shorts. Right, if I get triggered in here, I'll have the same of on each side. And therefore, the risk is 0 for now? But I am uh I'm committed to paying swaps, the longer this stays the same, right? The longer this stays hedged, I'm, I have to pay swap. And one way to unwind the hedge. And the only way really is to start removing losing traits. Right, so offsetting, there we go. See now I'm triggered in. I need to offset this somehow. Right, I can start removing losers. And if I want to keep making money, I can also add a winner. Uh, maybe I can sell one extra. Right, so now I changed the offset. Right, so hedging kind of opens the can of worms. To both sides of the the the chart, right? Now you have 2 cans of worms, and you have worms everywhere. Right, in this particular account, this is a demo account, and so I'm running, I guess it's an experiment you can call it. I'm trying to figure out sizing and stuff like that for bigger boxes, and I've been carrying this now for I think a month, uh, but yeah, long story short, we have to be able to Create a track record every day. We have to be able to be flat every day, right? So if I'm in the hedge and I want to be committed to the long side, I have to clearly get out of these shorts, right? If I want to stay long, in this case, I'm trying to be long. I've been trying to be long for a long, long time. I need to remove the shorts. Right, I need to unwind the hedge. If I believe it's making me money on the short side. I, I keep one extra. I booked a profit, I maybe I booked a profit. I can wait. I can unwind the hedge, right? I just took the hedge off. Right, I can unwind the hedge. I can book a tiny tiny loss. Right? I don't have to disturb the original plan. The hedge just limits it from going further and further and further and further and further, right? The hedge puts a lid on things temporarily. You, it's still your responsibility, right? It did not make the problem go away, right? It did not make my drawdown go away. I'm still drawn down from the long side of the equation. But I'm using the short side to make money. Right, uh, if this was our regular trading session, and we would be, you know, trading a, a vanilla account, no, not an experimental something something, uh, it. The hedging would be easier to represent, because I'm off by 60 here, it introduces a dilemma. But we've we've covered this hedging topic in a previous video, right? So go check that out, come back to me with your questions. It's a, it's it's its own topic, right? Hedging is probably the last part of the puzzle that you want to get into, right? You want to be able to reduce, sorry, I just dropped a dish. Whew, I want, it didn't break. I want to be able to reduce my risk. I want to be able to transfer my risk, right? I transferred some of my risk to the short side. I made a little bit of money to the short side, and now I'm still stuck, right? I still have to remove two traits. To the short side, in order for me to keep my lungs, right? Once I remove my shorts, if I believe this is going long. I can add to the long side. Right, as long as I don't overcommit, like what Nick did, he reduced his risk and added boxes. That's basically what I'm trying to figure out with these trades over here. Right, on a 4 hour chart, I'm trying to figure out how many boxes, how long can it take with a 4 hour chart. So I'm doing the opposite extreme to the 1 minute chart. Yeah, it's taking a long, long time. It's really not my, my cup of tea. So anyways, right? So you can see the long is still on. I can still play the long side. I still make money on the short side. Right, I need to manage this environment. If I want to be flat at the end of the hour in 30 minutes from now. I need to book a loss, either here. Or the green trade up here, right? One of these two trades will have to lose. Right, it's it's impossible to unwind the hedge without losing on one side. And that's where the problem lies, right? So hedging is the last thing you want to get yourself into, whether, you know, whether you're offset like I am right here, or whether you're trading, you know, the equivalent one for one. It's a problem. It's just not a nice place to be, right? It's the worst tool in the toolbox. It's the last tool we want to get. To use, right? I don't want to use that tool in my toolbox. I would rather look at the time. And maybe understand it's not worth the risk, and not take the trade if I'm running out of time. Right? Or if I've already committed the two hour session and I'm left with a handful of trades, like so right here. A handful of trades, just booked a tiny tiny loss, right? It doesn't have to be, I must win, right? The breaking even idea is just that. Breaking even is your exit, right? So you can hold as is. No, you can basically stay committed to your original idea. If you've if you fulfilled your two hour session and you've run out of time. You can also maybe tighten up your stops. That will allow you to keep more of your profits. No, you don't give back so much. Because I'm in the US session, and because it is the end of the day, and because the day is slowing down. I choose option number one, right? I choose to just hold as is. I, I tend to not do anything. I just let it happen. Right. Reducing the risk and adding boxes is scenario number 3. Another alternative would be similar to tightening up the stops. But keeping them layered. Right, so instead of moving all of your stops at one location, You know, below the previous swing or something like that. You would, instead of allowing 36 pips per trade, maybe allow 27 pips per trade. Right, so you move all of the stops, the same amount, right, instead of moving them all at the same point. You move the stops the same amount. Right, so your risk is gradually sliding on the scale. Right? So 4 main strategies, um, the idea is to be able to come up with an alternative plan. When you take Plan A, when you execute plan A, you have to have Plan B in mind. Right, so if I take plan A and I take a trade, Thinking it's going up, you know, for example, I'm expecting it to bounce. Plan A is a bounce. Plan B would be breaking even. If it goes into box number 2. Right, so breaking even would be adding to my bounce. I think to my original idea, and now looking for that bounce between boxes 1 and 2. Right, I'm sliding on the scale. I'm sliding my wrist along the boxes. If it slips into box number 3, and I'm OK with this, this is maybe part of the plan, maybe this is a pullback that I'm participating in. My risk is sliding, right? I'm committing ever so slightly more money. But it's within uh an overall guided, you know, plan. I have 4% to spend. Right? And I'm understanding where I am in that bigger picture. Where am I willing Where am I willing to let go? Of that risk. Right? So, because of what we've done, because of the math, the box that you figured out, oh, that's not the chart I wanted. This is the one. Because of where we're coming from with our boxes, we know what happens if it's going into box 5 and 6, right? We talked about that earlier, right? We're trying to figure out which side to trade for the day. That's our top-down analysis. We're trying to figure out, well, we already know what the market is willing, able, and capable to pay us. We are picking 3 pips, the smallest unit of measure, which is a 1 minute bar. Right? So we're picking 3 pips, 3 pips, 3 pips, 3 pips. There's folks out there that are trading, you know, 40 pips, right? They're asking, Mr. Market, please give me 40 pips. Or maybe I'm willing to lose 40 5s, right? A 1 to 1 trade. If you're doing a 2 to 1 trade, maybe you're willing to lose, you know, $10 in exchange for making $20. Right? You have to understand where you are and what the potential of the market is, right? The potential is fifty-fifty. We have to figure out what the trend, so-called trend is to figure out if it's 60/40, 70/30, 90/10. You know, there's one side that's leading, right? Cause otherwise it's fifty-fifty. Right? We pick the top of the hill on purpose, because our probability for being right, I've clearly shown this now for 2 years on record, 3 pips is 98%. Right, you can make 3 pips almost 98% of the time. Right? It's when things change abruptly, and we're incapable of adapting that typically we have an issue, and that's why we avoid news, right? The news catalyst, the news event itself, tends to blow through the boxes faster than we can cope with. And so by coming in after the news, Right? We can mitigate some of that risk, right? Going back to this picture here. Right? We can, we can use time, time of day, and all these outside parameters. To guide our behavior. The last guide is the box. And even the box helps you gauge risk in real time, right? Where you are within the box, how much money you've spent within the box. Right, so at the end of your trading session, because time is a hard stop, You're limited as to, you know, what you can do, but it helps to have a plan ahead of time. Me, because of time of day, like I've said before, I tend to hold as is. I accept the risk, right? I've accepted it when I clicked on the mouse. Right? For some of you, maybe you're in Europe, and you're trading the trend, you're building the body of the candle. Maybe you are faced with a runaway market. And so if it is the end of your 2 hour session, you would be well advised to peel off. Some of your trades, remove your worst losers. You don't have to remove everything, right? This is why we have a layered stock. Uh, Yeah, so Nick is asking about moving the break even to the, uh, moving to take profits to break even, because as the trades close. The break even line, the average price will move, right? Hence, this is when I come in and tend to recycle my trades if I have time. If I don't have time, if so, if I move my stock because I ran out of the two hour window, I just let it unfold as it's. Right, so the break even will move, but I'm also booking wins as it moves, right? So I'm kind of agreeing to the smaller loss. Does that make sense? I'm, I'm kind of accepting. The fact that it may pull back. Right, so I can see, I, I, I can see what he's talking about, right? When we go to the chart. And we have, let's say our break even line. Let's say I take another bite. I'll take 23 buys, right? So now I have 3 buys and I have 2 cells. As the market starts to move and close some of my trades, it will move the breakeven line, right? So if the market pushes up, as soon as I close one trade, the average price changes. As soon as I close the second trade, the average price changes yet again. So every time I close a trade, the average of the remaining trade is changing. And I suggested moving the Stop losses. To below the low, right? And so that's kind of the idea, right? If the price goes through one and then backs away, at least you've booked one and the others aren't losing you as much. Right, if it doesn't back away, if it keeps going and going and going, your break even keeps going and going. Like you're eventually gonna wipe out the board, you're gonna wipe out the slate. Right? So, yeah, you just, it's a choice we have to make, and it's discretion, right? Each day is a different day. This is why we have a host of tools in our box, right? We, we can do this, this, this, or this. There's a likelihood, there's a probability that one tool is the best tool to use. And it's over time, you figure out this particular situation calls for this particular outcome. But it's a blend, right? It's not. A lot of folks come to trading thinking it's just rule-based. If I just follow all the rules, I'll make a bazillion dollars. If it was that simple, we'd all be rich, because I would just program some machine to do these steps. Right? People have the ability to kind of think about what happened and incorporate that in what may be happening, and just, you know, as a matter of fact, uh, you know, because of what's happening. You can even look at Projections, no predictions. The polymarket is one that I look at quite a bit. You know, it gives you an idea of what the market is thinking, right? These are the kind of risks that I'm incorporating in my train of thought every single day. No, I, this does not deal with the euro specifically, but there are instances where, uh, people are asking, not people, but the market in general is hedging their, their bets. The market is thinking Trump will do one thing versus another. And you can kind of see what the market is thinking. In certain aspects outside of the chart, right? So, uh, There was one earlier where it talked about the euro. Where is it? Uh, maybe I'll find it later. But yeah, it, there is, there's predictions for all sorts of stuff out there. And also when we're managing risk, you can incorporate all sorts of ideas in order to manage risk, right? It doesn't have to be. Strict rule base. Rule-based stuff uh has a purpose. It fits, it fits a place. There is a place for that, and I've, I've created robots that made me money, but I ended up having to manage those robots. And so I went back to managing trades instead, right? There's, there's There's a piece of trading that has to be human involved, like you, you have to be there for it, and to make those types of decisions, right? There we are, we're booking a profit, so now our break even theoretically would have changed. But my stock losses would all be at the same place still. Right, so now if it chooses to not fulfill the other two take profits and just come back, at least I've reduced the risk. I've removed one or two trades, and I'm left losing one or two trades with less than an ejection seat. Right, so the other piece to remember is during your trading session. You may be compelled to change your mind, right? Something may come along and says, oh, I have to change my bias, and now you're left with trades remaining, right? You may be starting to buy while you still have cells on the board. Right? Those trades have to be dealt with. That's rare, you know, that would be kind of semi-hedged temporarily, and that's also because there's time in front of you. Right, so a lot of what happens happens. Uh, after you've accounted for all these variables. Right, so this is why uh I had a question actually in the Slack group, if I trade indices, because they move very fast, they're very volatile, and I haven't replied yet, but my answer is no. I, I try not to, right? When I try when I trade futures, when I trade uh the the NASDAQ, it's usually in the evening, no, aftermarket because it's slower, right? I need time to think things through. Right? And it's, it gives me time to have a plan of action. Uh, the last couple of days, I've been trading this, I've been trading futures, uh, microcontracts. Right, micro euros, because I'm familiar with the euro, right? I'm content with what the euro does. I'm, I can manage this type of risk, right? I don't want to be, especially in the, you know, in the next 4 years, I don't want to try something new. Right, I wanna be doing what I do best, and I want to be religious about it. Uh, if I can get it done within 20 minutes, I get it done within 20 minutes. Right? So it's all about avoiding risk for the next 4 years, right? Avoiding risk for the next 4 years. Right? And then the risk that I am taking over the next 4 years is greatly reduced. Right. Typically it's going to be 2 hours per day or less, and it's every other like uh because I rotate through many, many, many accounts, or 12, I don't, I don't get to revisit the same account, usually in the same, you know, in the same environment, so things change quite a bit between my trading sessions. Right? So, a lot of what I do is designed to reduce. And avoid Right? And so when I am trading, I'm either accepting the risk, as is, and I'm, you know, I make my money, or once in a while I'll eject because the market needed that thirty-seventh Pip. You know, but it's extremely rare that I find myself hedging. I, I just don't want to go down that road because it leaves me. With a losing side. Right, which has to be dealt with over time. Uh, just for a matter of example, a friend of mine was hedged a euro yen for 4 months. He did not make any money for 4 months while unwinding a euro yen hedge. It, it, the, the kind of the mindset you need for hedging is double trouble, right? You have to have the ability to manage two books. Two trains of thought, 2 goals, 2 sets of, it's, it's literally double trouble. You're trying to put toothpaste back into 2 tubes. Don't go there. Right? Until you can put toothpaste back into one tube, right? Learn to lose. Before you learn to hedge. Right? Learn to lose in the original direction that you picked. Before you go down the hedging road, right? Even though I've been providing you guys the material and stuff, try that stuff in a demo account, right? Don't do the hedging in your where you're trying to create a track record. OK, so a lot of what will happen, using this methodology is going to be bigger than average or smaller than average. Our goal, our objective is to shoot for average, right, the top of the bell curve. And so this, this whiteboard idea, uh, where is my whiteboard? This whiteboard idea over here is really How we manage our train of thought, right? I looked to see if it's a bullish trend on the daily. And then within the day itself, within the last 16 hours, I'm trying to figure out am I at the top of the day or the bottom of the day, right? Am I faced with a potential move with the trend, or am I faced with the potential move against the trend? And if it's against the trend, I give it 4 boxes, because that's the average that I've learned to expect. Once in a while, it needs that little extra bit. And that's where I'm willing to eject one or two traits, right? But it's extremely rare that the thing just keeps on going and going and going, and we lose everything, right? If that happens to you, it's because you got caught in the trend. Right? So go back a step, go back and figure out your top down analysis. Right? Were you willing to take that risk? Were you really, were you really willing To buy the high. Right, you have to have a plan. If the buying the high does not work out, how will I get out of this? By adding a second trade and looking for the average of the two, right? So the average of the two is not a, it's not just a hope and a wish, right? It's an expectancy. We, we add. With the goal of capturing a bounce. Right? So when Right here, when this thing bounces. When this thing bounces, you made money. Yay, right? You were buying on the way down. And it bounced and made you money. A few minutes later, you're repeating the same process. Oh, it's coming back down. I'm buying, I'm I'm buying, I'm buying, and instead of bouncing, It broke down. It did not go to the South Pole. It went one standard deviation, and because you're now adding on the way down, you're expecting it to bounce and you get out at break even. Now you're getting out at the average of the two boxes, because you've added the same amount of money. And you have the expectancy. From your box. You expect the box, the box provides you the support you need to believe it, right? You believe in the box, you believe in the work that you did, right? The box comes from the market. The market told you, I moved this many pips. And it takes this long on average. And because it's happening faster than average, right? It's happening faster than the 60 bars. You are making an acknowledgement of that move. And you're triggering off the expectancy, right? The speed of which was faster than should have been, you're gonna profit from that. Right, we're exchanging time for money or money for time. And because the move, the change happened so quickly. Our edge was right there. Time for money, money for time. Right, Imagine doing this on the NASDAQ when things are moving, you know, 10 times faster and each tick is way, way, way, way, way, way more money. It's very, very difficult. It's not undoable, but it's difficult, right? I, uh, the box does work on the NASDAQ. The box does work on all the other markets. There's a box for everything. You just have to have the risk management and the money management to support what the box is telling you. And when I'm creating futures, it's just too fast and too rich for my blood. Right? That doesn't mean it won't work for you, right? It's just not for me, it's not my cup of tea, right? So, uh, what we're learning to do. Is this, right? We either bounce. Or we don't. And if we don't bounce, we typically don't bounce more than once. And so we can measure the clues. And eventually come out ahead, right? So, going back to this. If you see yourself doing your top down analysis, And you see yourself starting on time, it won't take very long, maybe a few months, you'll soon understand what you're up against each and every day. I'm I'm at the high of the day, or I'm at the low of the day. My average day does this, my potential average yield is this. Each and every day is not very far away from yesterday. Each and every day is very, very similar to the day before. I look around you, does the world change all that fast? No, right? The, the so-called trend, we revisit the same prices time and time and time again. Right? So the trend is an idea that was sold to us, that has us stuck into this mindset. That once I'm in the trade, it has to go to the moon, right? It has to go to the South Pole. In reality, it only has to do an average move. And then something else comes along. We are here for the something else. Right? Because we can measure the move in front of us right now. Especially if we have an idea of what the direction should be, and the move right now is either in our favor or against that direction, right? So right away we have a clue. If it's in the direction of the trend, we expect more than 4 boxes. If it's against us, we expect no more than 4 boxes, plus or minus a couple of peps, right? It's just an average. It's not deadly accurate, but it's absolutely good enough. It is perfect. And so I'm not looking for Uh, The overall, you know, where are we gonna end up next month. I really don't care for that, right? My job is to figure out where I am right now and where we're gonna end up in an hour from now. So the next move, that's it, the next hourly candle, right? So, the risk that you take. You acknowledged it when you first clicked the mouse. Right, the trader in you followed the guidelines that led you to clicking your mouse for a certain reason. And now the risk manager in you. has nothing to do if that trade works out. If the probability works out, the risk manager has absolutely nothing to do. So we wait for a bounce and we enter with the boxes. Not necessarily. There's more to it than that, Andrea. Uh, if you're new to this theory, to this thesis, go and check the original material that we put out, the, the, the stuff on Kajabi, because you, you have to put in the legwork within the box. You have to figure out the box itself, and right away you will see. How the box comes into play. Once you understand where the box comes from, you will, you will see it for yourself, and then within the first, you know, the first couple of recordings you watch. You will answer your own question right there. Right, we, we do play bounces, we do play bounces within the boxes, but if you do yourself a huge favor and create your own box with your own data set, That question right there will answer itself, and your future with this method will be clear as day. Well, that might be overstating it. I've been doing it for 8 years. It, it will be clearer, right? So, figure out the box, because understanding where the box comes from sets the stage for everything else we do thereafter, right? It is the risk management tool that we have. It allows us to gauge the risk we're taking, like in this case here, I'm still wasting time, right? This is now opportunity cost, right? 1 hour of not making any money and floating $600. Right, so this is the kind of stuff that goes through my mind. Uh, every 2 hours, I try to rotate to a different environment, and that's risk management, uh, to a certain degree, right? It's called broker risk. I don't have all my accounts in one place. I don't have all my eggs in one basket. Right, so, uh, Basically you try to spread your risk around. OK. And so the, the idea of managing this risk at the end of the day, it's really accepting the risk at the beginning of the day. Right? We start with the willingness to lose. And then we work our darnness to read it right, um, to read between the lines. We do what we do best using the measuring tools that we have, and by not overspending, right? Overspending is committing a huge huge sin. That's, that's how everybody ends up blowing the account. It's not because they had bad intentions. Right, people end up blowing up because they overcommit. Right? So, one of the tools at our disposal is to measure things. And maybe reduce the risk if you need more space. Right? You can measure space, you can measure what the market is capable of, and therefore you can allocate the funds. Right, so we're not expecting. Uh, the monthly recording. Uh, yeah, well, that one too. Uh, if I'm talking about the monthly recording, you're asking last month's recording, uh, no, I'm more talking about the Kajabi, the original material, you know, the, the original course material. It all of the stuff we've put out there is, is useful, you know, there's little golden nuggets in pretty much every recording we've put out. Uh, yeah, a lot of what we do is discretionary. And so if you're coming from a rule-based background, like if you're, if you're a robot trader, uh, this will have you bewildered, right? Because a lot of what we do is Anticipating the next move, and we don't necessarily have uh confirmation, right? We're trading preemptively. I'm taking the trade as a test. Of something I, I'm testing a hypothesis. I'm testing support, testing support, testing support. And if I find what I'm testing for, I make money every time. Right, so if I'm testing support, and there's a there's an intended direction in mind, It would have to be up, right? If I'm testing support, I'm hoping support is hold, is holding, and therefore the price will continue to go up. Right? So it's an assumption. I'm preemptively testing support, right? I don't need that confirmation. The confirmation is what makes me 3 pairs. OK, so, yeah, figure out your box from those recordings, all the data is there, everything you need is there to create the box. I'll be available, you know, to answer your questions. As far as the risk management is concerned, you have to be understanding of what you're getting into. Right, you're, you have the willingness to lose 4%. If you don't work the numbers out so you lose less than 4%. Maybe you're risking a 0.5% per box. Right, I'm just giving you a guideline, right? 1% per box. The worst case scenario is you lose all 4 boxes. You know, the market goes right through everything, and now you're down 4%. That's not the end of the world. Right, it's just a matter of showing up again and hopefully not repeating the same mistake. Right, we overwhelm our losses. With winds upon winds upon winds upon wins, right? So at the end of the day, remember, you can hold it as is, don't do anything. You can tighten up your stops, and now anticipate break even to move every time you close a trade. Right? You can replace your stop losses with a hedge. That's not a good way of looking at risk, right? That's not what we want to do. There are specific cases where maybe that is what you're forced to do. Right? So that's kind of the last item in my bag of tricks, right? I really don't want to go down that hedging path. And then another scenario similar to layering your stops, is to move them and even out. Right, just tighter and tighter and tighter, but keeping the distance the same. OK, so there's uh the approach. Right, the approach to risk is in the mind. It really lies between your ears. Right? And then planning that next move, understanding where you're coming from and where you're trying to go. And if you run out of time before you got to your destination, The end of your session. You have to either accept as is. You can reduce And remove some of the risk from the table, or close some of the traits. Right? Try not to go down the transferring path because that will open the door to, you know, another, uh, Curriculum Right? More practice, more trouble, more problem solving. It's a whole new career path almost, right? So, focus on these three right here. OK. And then I'll be available for you, uh, in the Slack group. I know a lot of you guys have messaged me over the last few days, so some of you must be brand new. Uh, I will get to your messages, just buy me a little bit of time, please. And uh we'll be in touch. All right, I'm here to help you, so uh we'll get it done together. All right. Enjoy yourselves, Trade small. Thank you everybody for joining. See you next time.


## 13 2025 February - The Psychology of Successful Scalping aac

OK, now everybody's, uh, joining slowly. Welcome to this month's sculping mastery call. It's our 7th call, and today we are going to talk about the psychology of the method. So I'm sure we're all very excited about that. Now, before I pass this over to uh Jean Francois, um, I just want to remind you that um you can um write any questions you have in the chat, and, um, you know, he'll be having a look at that and uh be answering them for you. All right, over to you Charanson. All righty. So, good morning, uh, good afternoon, good evening, everyone. Uh, it is 10 o'clock Eastern on the 26th of February, and as you can see my screen, I'm not sharing my trading platform. Instead, I'm just sharing a meme, baby steps to Big Dream, and that's essentially what we're trying to achieve when we pick up trading. But within the first few trades, we kind of give up the idea of baby steps and immediately jump into, you know, home runs, right? We have to leap to success, and that leads to immediate failure. And I'm sure some of you have experienced this, right? Uh, some of you have already blown in that account, or 2 or 3. Uh, me, even a demo account. Can be, you know, hurtful to your, to your psyche, if you, you know, uh, if you put a lot of effort into creating the perfect track record and all of a sudden it slips through your fingers. And so a lot of that stuff we take ownership of and it really is nothing that we can do about it. Like there's, it's in the hands of the market, right? So the market really controls. The outcome, once the trade is open, but you can interfere. Right? So those baby steps don't all have to be. Uh, The same Uh, I identical baby steps, right? So you do earn the right to grow, you do earn the right to be discretionary sometimes, to do the right thing under the right circumstance, right? So you're not boxed in. Right? So these baby steps really just lead the way forward without trying to put the cart in front of the horse, right? So the next thing we have to remember with these baby steps leading to, you know, big dreams is that it, it fills in the gap. It fills in this lot of large numbers, and it does so. One trade at a time, right? So think of the sample size that you would be trading. As a swing trader, right? So your sizing is based on the amount of money you're willing to risk based on your stop. And so if you're trading a risk to reward ratio, 2 to 13 to 1, your stop might be in the order of, you know, 40 pips because you're trying to make 80 pips. Right? So that complicates things because the further out you're looking for that outcome, the more the probabilities are going to slip away. So we've already addressed this by lowering the bar as low as the bar can go. Right, so now all of a sudden our targets are achievable, repeatable. Consistently so. Right? And we're basically fulfilling the law of large numbers. Right? So instead of taking 10 years to put in 1000 trades, 1000 swing trades, we do 1000. Scalps in a matter of, you know, a couple of months. Right? So it really is the law of large numbers unfolding in front of us, right? We're generating this day by day by day. Each day, Is its own track record. We just happen to tack it on to the day before and the day before that and the day before, right? That's how we create our equity curve, where most swing traders create their equity curve one trade at a time. We create our series of trades at a time. Right? So a series of trade for us is an average day. And so we aim to fulfill our average. And and off to the beach, right? So we're we are controlling. Our throughput. Both from a risk perspective and a over trading perspective, right? We're keeping a lid. On the over trading. That We otherwise, you know, fall into the trap, right? So this is really what we have to focus on. Right? Just focus on doing your average best. Based on the guidelines that we have, based on the structure that's in front of you, Right? So you have the, the facts that are in front. You're not trying to invent traits that are not there. Right? You are really just trying to do your best up to That, you know, fulfilling that 2 hour window and or meeting your average, right? Whichever comes first. And then you stop for that day and you come back and repeat the next day, and the next day and the next day and the next day, right? I'm sure you've heard me say this many, many times, right? Stop every day. Now you have to put a stop to your trading every single day. And that enables you to keep your wins, without having to give them back. And so it's us fulfilling our average, our personal best for that day. Without Trying to break world records, right? We're competing against our yesterday, our self from yesterday. Right, so the idea of consistency is really to make sure That whatever you do today, Does not complicate your tomorrow. Right, so try to repeat the same things that led you to being successful the day before and the day before that and the day before. Our guidelines show us how to move the boxes around, right? But we never changed the size of the box. We changed the expectations. Based on the content of the box. Right? So, this right here is never going to be the same, but it's always in the vicinity of your average. And so even if you have your bias upside down, you're wrong. Provided you aim to end trading, so provided you know you have an end coming up. You're basically Uh, uh, Forced to engineer the outcome. You're forced To either start booking losses, or start dispensing the remaining clicks to get an average move out of the market, right? Not trying to move the market, but you're trying to move your average price, right? So every day requires a different trick from the bag of tricks. Right? So your bag of tricks has 16 clicks in it. And it's up to the situation at hand. To reach into your tool bag and pull out the right tools to fix that problem that day. Right? So, in theory, what you have is a lot more control than you ever thought possible. And this is kind of the difference between what you may have been doing in the past. And what we're trying to do now. Uh, actually, let's start from the beginning. Some of you may have seen this slide, some of you may not. So I'm just gonna start here very quickly. Uh, as a beginning trader, we all at some point will experience beginner's luck, right? We we win a trade or two and we don't know how or why. It was so easy, right? Oh, that money just fell on my lap. That's kind of how we fall in love with trading, right? That's what keeps us coming back every day, right? We want to re-experience this. And for many of you, me included, we'll spend years looking for that holy grail. And some of you will even give up to your, you know, you'll give up your idea that trading is for you, right? Some of you are so hyper focused on opening of the trade, looking for the best trades on the entry side of the equation, that you're looking for a so-called holy grail, right? You're thinking, if I have the perfect entry, The exit can't go wrong. Well, I'm here to prove that wrong, right? As soon as you open the trade, Mr. Market takes control of the outcome. And it's only the risk manager that chooses to either close it. Or add. That we can change the outcome of the said trait, right? So right here, this loss of confidence is because we really don't know. From the foundation of trading, what it is we're trying to do, right? We have to break up the task into its components, right? So, part of it is having a strategy to operate, but then at some point, you have to be An operator of that strategy. You can't just throw the strategy away and move to the next one. You have to settle on something that's good enough. Take it from there and make it better, right? So for our strategy, the scalping method, It's expected to start approximately in the high 70s. If you think of the bell curve, right, the top of the bell curve, two standard deviations, it's approximately 68 to 70%. Of the data that we look at, right? So, translated, it's approximately 68 to 70% win rate. 3 pips, 3 pips, 3 pips. We start with the 70% win rate. And with years of practice and experience and showing up every day, doing the same thing every day, you take that 70 and you crank it up to the high 90s, right? You become a better operator of one particular method. Right? And then at at that point, you're now no longer breaking even. You're making money. And this is typically where most of you reach out to me right here, right? Most of you will have had some trading experience. Most of you will have had wins and losses. Most of you have created some kind of a track record, but you're not moving forward, right? It's, it's, it's kind of like uh turning into a nightmare, right? Instead of moving the equity curve up, it's staying flat. You're wasting time. And so when you come to find me, I help you tune the instrument that you've created for yourself, but it's only making noise, right? So by tuning the instrument, by including the X axis on your chart, all of a sudden you start making music. Right, it's only because 99% of you out there have never been exposed to time cycles. Uh, you've been focusing only on the price. Right? So, focusing only on price, focusing on the statistical outcome. A 2 to 13 to 1 risk to reward ratio. It has you experiencing uh uh It's almost like a, a spiral of doom. Right? Your brain automatically rewires itself to try and avoid losing. Right? Society is not training us to be losers, right? From birth, you're expected to be nothing but a winner. And then when it comes to trading, all of a sudden, all you do is experience losses. So now your brain is trying to figure out a way to stop losing. Instead of learning how to lose, right? So that's problem number 1. Problem #2 is internal. You're operating from a stress hormone. Right? And so there's nothing good about this, right? You can change your diet, you can change, you can become, you know, you can go to church every week, it's still going to cause you anxiety every time you turn on your laptop. Right, you're fearful of more and more and more losses, because as a swing trader, we typically have, you know, maybe a 60% win rate if we're lucky, right? So we experience, typically, series of losses. It's not just one loser. Uh, once in a while. Right? So now you're operating from fear with the wrong hormones, your brain is rewiring for all the wrong reasons. I remember me personally, years ago, I lost so much money, uh, when I turned on the laptop first thing in the morning, I threw up on my keyboard. Like, I, I had physical pain because of the size of the loss. And, and so after a while, you do this over and over and over, you're now afraid of risk. And so it's like a it's like getting, getting a job at the fire hall and instead of, you know, running into burning buildings to save people, you run away from them. Why, why be a trader if you're going to be afraid of risk? Right, so after a while you do this too long, and now you're under confident and that you're basically operating from irrational pessimism. You're blaming the market for everything that goes wrong, right? It's out to get me. It sees me coming. They know I have my stop lost there. It's stop hunting me. All of that is BS. It's all made up. It's all in your mind. Right? So, in order to get away from this, we change 11 variable, only one variable. Right? Instead of targeting a statistical outcome that's twice as large as our risk, Which we may never get, and if you do, most of us are trained to take half off and let the other half run while we move our stops to break even. And that behavior takes that 2 to 1 and turns it into a 1.24 tree. And that remaining half that you're leaving to run now has to go twice as far to be a 2 to 1 tree, right? So we're trained. Uh, become an operator with the wrong guidelines. And there's nothing wrong with a positive risk reward ratio, but the way we go about deploying that is flawed. OK? So by changing that one variable, changing what we expect as the outcome. Right? So instead of expecting a home run, Lower the bar as low as the bar can go. And now you're expecting to make it to first base. And you're trying to get to first base over and over and over, right? Therefore, going around the bases, right? And that one variable, the target, Instead of being a random target every day based on whatever chart I happened to be looking at that day, right? Swing trading involves a universe of instruments. It involves a universe of trades each day that's different from the day before. When you're swing trading, you're creating nothing but variability, right? You're, you're in an environment that is variable and remains variable. When we're operating as an insurance company, Everybody pays the same premium. Everybody receives the same premium, 3 pips, 3 pips, 3 pips, 3 pips. On the flip side of that, we're all managing the risk of being wrong at some point. And so it's our job to be on the lookout for being raw. OK, so changing the target makes it achievable, makes it repeatable, makes it consistent. Now all of a sudden your brain is seeking this reward. It's like a mouse in a maze looking for cheese, and you're finding this cheese. You want more cheese. Right? So now it's a very different hormone. You're operating from testosterone. It's exciting. It's pleasurable. I, I bounce out of bed to come and do this with you guys. Even when you're not here, I bounce out of bed to do this on my own. Uh, I seek to manage this type of risk, right? Because I can control it, I can control the outcome. And even when the market has something in store for me, I can choose when enough is enough. I don't have to sit here and get beat up. Right? That's what the industry expects you to do, right? They tell you to show up, take a small loss, try it again. Take a small loss, try it again. Take a small loss, try it again. Every time you take a small loss, guess what? You're losing money. And that money has to be paid back. You're wondering why you can't get past breaking even. Stop taking so many small losses. Right? And you won't have to pay yourself that money back. So what we do is we operate in an environment of drawdown, right? We allow this drawdown. In the moment, because we understand that in time, Work in progress closes favorably. Right? So all of a sudden, we have this achievable target. We're operating from an hormone standpoint that has us coming back for more. It's not an addiction. It's you solving a problem every day. Right? It's pleasurable, it's seeking the risk, but now the psychology. Becomes the flip side of the coin. We're now walking around like peacocks. We think we're invincible. And this is the worst place to be, right? This is exactly when the market will deliver your head on your silver platter. And this is why I preach to you folks. Please, please, meet your daily average. And walk away. Walk away before you become the peacock. Right? Walk away before you're feeling the irrational exuberance. Right? You don't want to get to the stage where, oh my God, this is the best I've ever done. And then at that very moment, you're gonna try to do one more trade, and one more trade leads to disaster. Right? So get to your average based on the situation at hand, maybe a little bit more, maybe a little bit less, but it's an average. It's not a world record. Right? And so this is why the psychology of what we do supports what we do, right? Baby steps. Not big fat old trades, you know, these big fat trades have a place, but not While we're trying to make 3 pips, 35s, 35s. You will, as you're making 3 5s, 3 ips, you will see potential for swings. And that's kind of where I come in. That's what I do most of my swings. I see that potential. I can count in boxes, right? So I'm counting standard deviations. If I'm risking 4 standard deviations from my stop loss. It makes sense that we expect at least 4 standard deviation for the reward. Rendering the trade of at least 1 to 1 risk to reward ratio, right? So you can think in standard deviations. It's also preferable if you separate your strategies, right, so you don't want to be running the same, or you don't want to be running multiple strategies in one pool of money, right, that will lead you to borrowing from Peter to pay Paul. It will lead you to over-risking, right? So what I recommend most folks do is you have a swing trading account. Or, you know, you have a miscellaneous account, and then you have your 33 Pip account. Right? And then that will enable you to manage the risk independent of each other, and organize your, you know, next move, organize your budget, your money for that next move. Independent of what's happening in the other account. Right, so the, the piece that's been missing. For all of your trading so far, it's been this time axis. Right? And this missing bit of information leads you to go crazy, right? It leads you, it, it leads you to chase your own tail, trying to figure out why this is not working. Right? Because the industry has us focusing on price, only price, right? Buy low. Sell high And in between you're supposed to wait. But nobody has told you what it is you were waiting for. Right, so all of a sudden, now you understand that there's a cycle involved. And if I bought the low, And I'm waiting for a cycle, then I know when to get out. And expecting something on the moon is pointless, because what you saw as a successful trade now turns negative, and all of a sudden you're praying all the way to where you're now panicking because it's turned into a loss. You were expecting this. Because nobody told you. The cycle is coming up and probably over. Right? So, understanding cycles on any of the time frame. Will put you ahead of the guy beside you. Right, so if you figure out your price and time cycle on an intermediate time frame, That's OK. Right, you, you're, you might be trading inside of a one hour box, and then inside of that one hour box, maybe you can break it up into quadrants. And you can break that up into quadrants, you know, and now you're you're operating your little 9 pip box, and you're allowing yourself 4 of them. Right, there's a The psychology behind what I'm showing you guys is really the ability to come up with a solution. Right? Because we're not operating with one trade, hoping and wishing for that one outcome. We're We have the ability to dispense. Those 1st 4 clicks. To target the original goal, 3 5s, 3 5s, 35s. If those 1st 4 clicks don't deliver the outcome you're looking for, The premise is already in trouble, right? You're already not bouncing into the target, you're already going deeper into drawdown. And so immediately going into box number 2. Is helping you fix what's what's happening in box number one. And if the psychology is there, maybe you're willing to give it a shot for box number 3 and box number 4. Knowing that it's only a matter of time. Before what you expected here comes to you. Right? It's a matter of time. When the time is right. The price will do what the price has to do. Right? And the people on the opposite side of the screen are professional traders for the majority, and they're operating on a Uh, a calendar, a schedule, there's a reason for them doing what they do. It's not willy-nilly. And so think of today in particular, right? The 26th of February, the second last day of the month, or two days before the month end. It's considered value date. Right? Yeah, if you, if you remember or if you're familiar with trading stocks or equities. There's a 2 day settlement, right? So for any trades to show up on the books for the month of February, They have to be put through today. Otherwise, they'll show up for the month of March. Right? So it, it takes 2 days to show up on the paperwork, and some of these bigger players have some rebalancing to do. So what you see as this big ass move. It's some other guy's job. And we can understand this based on time of day, time of the week, time of the month, and what the outcome of these moves have been in the past, right? So we study a little bit of the past, so that we can kind of remain calm. Today and tomorrow, right? It really is a function. Of understanding yesterday. And expecting today to be somewhat similar. Nothing really changes that much in the world. I look around. You get up every day, same time, you go to do the same job, you come back, you do the same thing. It's the same for everyone. Markets are included in that. Right? So, from a psychology standpoint, we have a lot more. Uh, freedom. Then we're led to believe and we take so much. Uh, ownership when the trades go wrong. Most people forget that the markets. Chose the outcome of that trade, right? Not the operator. The operator has a say in the outcome. We can change the outcome as it's evolving. We can Interfere with it, but it's still the market being the market, right? It's a, it's a river of opportunities, right? So, in order to remain calm and to remain, you know, like a bystander or more like a monk. Right? We're not getting pulled apart by our losses, and we're not super excited about our wins either. It's just a job. Right, in order to remain in this mode. It helps if we have these core patterns to look at, something to rely on, something to expect, or something to suspect may be happening. And Coincidentally, we have these axioms that go along with this. It's like the story that goes behind the picture. Right? So, axiom number one tells us, if we're trying to find support, if our job, is to test for support in order to find a bounce and make 3 pips. It's only going to work because axiom number one tells you, support happens to be an upward move in price. Caused by demand. That means there's demand somewhere else, somewhere else. That's what's causing the bounce. Right, so right here, that little picture there. Right? On the way down, we're expecting the bounce, we're expecting support, and so we buy, buy, buy on the way down, and if this is truly support, It bounces. And how we made our money, right? So, axiom number 2 says, A trend starts. With the failure. Of support. Right, so, come a few minutes later, we're approaching the same support area. If we were to buy buy buy like we did a few minutes ago. And now we're faced with axiom number 2. Our buys may be in trouble. If there is no bounce. Right, so the failure to bounce would create panic for a lot of people. We see it as a normal. Low probability event, right? It's supposed to bounce first, the low probability is it doesn't bounce. And in our world, We see this as a box. And we see this as the start of the next box. And also in our world, we don't. All of a sudden panic and think it's going to the South Pole. Right? We understand it's only going maybe 1 box away, maybe 2 boxes away, maybe 3 boxes away. Ultimately, It's looking for a place to turn around, and we know that. Because that's axiom #3. Right? So by following along, boxes 23, and 4, the market is leaving all sorts of clues behind, right? And these clues, we can measure. Using our boxes. Right? So again, we're thinking things through, as things are evolving, we're moving our boxes along, we're measuring things as they evolve, and we can put ourselves on the right. Mode, or we can figure out where we need to be based on what we see in front of us. And typically, you know, on an average day, I find myself at the bottom of the day or at the top of the day. At 10 o'clock Eastern. And I have a pretty good idea which axiom I happen to be walking in. At that time. Right, so if I happen to be walking in on axiom number 3, I'll be buying on the way down, expecting a move like this. Right? If I happen to be walking in axiom number 2, right? So we've fallen maybe, you know, 9 pips, 10 pips. There's the potential to go all the way to 18 pips. There's the potential to go all the way to 27 pips, right? If that's the way that things are unfolding, I might be on axiom number 2. Right? But if I'm just recycling my 3 ip trade into the next 3-pi trade, into the next 3-I trade without ever seeing any kind of drawdown, I might just be writing axiom number one. Right? So, understanding where we are in the gray, like it's, if you see this as just an average market cycle. Right? And there's another one, and there's another one. Depending on what you're walking in at the time, you have a pretty good understanding of what you're supposed to do here, without having to panic, without having to stress, it's just a review of the immediate past. That kind of leads you to figuring out the immediate future. Not I'm using the word immediate. Right, we're not trying to hit the ball out of the park. Right? Think of the weather. If you're trying to figure out what you're supposed to wear today, you're not gonna check the 14 day forecast. You're gonna look out the window. This is what we do, right? Look at what axiom is happening right now in front of you. And ride that into the next axiom. Right, and eventually, It's the uh it recycles, right? You end up back at the top, you It's axiom number 12, and 3 that leads back to axiom number 1. Right. 12, and 3, that leads back to axiom number 1. Over and over and over, right? So the psychology of the method is really to take a deep breath. Have plan B figured out, have plan C figured out. Right, so understand where you need to have. The next box. Or what may be the potential next box. Figure out where your next 4 clicks will be lined up. Before you need them. Right? And right away, you're thinking about that next move. And you're no longer trying to chase. The current move. Right, uh, where am I? Where's my mouse? Oh, there it is. Right, so here, here's a really good outcome. I'm in the money. Right, so I'm gonna let these rides. I have a bunch of swing trades here. I'm gonna let these ride. I'm looking for a target closer to 550. And I'm not even doing the 3535 thing right now, right? These are just swings while I'm sitting here talking to you guys, and I'm not Stressed about it. I'm not panicked about it. I'm just gonna let it. Follow my plan. If my plan works out, my plan works out. If my plan is flawed, or the probabilities shift. As things are under way. The stoplos are there. You know, in order to stop the damage, right? The problem with swing trading is really there's no room for interference. Uh, you're expected to have that one trade with that one faraway target, and you're not expected to do anything else. We build a position. So we have that same amount at risk, 1%, but it's broken up into 4 pieces. And so right away, the probability of success goes up. That's, that's a good feeling. That's good for psychology. Right? So that probability of success is kind of what we're steering. By spreading our clicks. And if the 1st 4 clicks don't work, Where do we end up? We end up in box number 2, right? So if we're now upside down in box number 2, The freedom that we have, right? The the ability to operate. In an envelope of risk, right? This bubble of drawdown that we allow for ourselves. It's because we can see. That next move and its potential. And at the same time, we have a lower limit, maybe 36 pips, that is enough space to allow for a few more of these boxes, right? We're allowing ourselves the opportunity to find what it is we're looking for. Right, but in theory, if you're just brand new and you're just starting out. The first thing you're being trained to play. Is this breakout right there. And nobody has told you. What leads to the breakout and the destination of the breakout. are highly likely a similar Move, A B equals CD. Right. Very few people understand that fact right out of the gate. They know how to play breakouts, because that's what they were told to do. And so they know that there's a potential trade here, but they also tried it there and it failed. They also tried it here and it failed. And when it finally does work, they think it's going to the moon. When in reality, it's going one standard deviation away, and it is highly likely coming back. And right here is when average Joe will panic. And close their trade in drawdown, instead of adding to that trade with parcel number 2. Right, so now by adding added to that trade, they have an average. And the next move might still deliver a successful outcome. Right? We think about the next move. While everybody else is trying to chase. The current move. Right? And so on the way up, we walk up to our computer, we see the bullish trend, we might, we see resistance. Average Joe is trying to follow this, right? They have this fear of missing out. It's green, green, green, green, green. Oh my God, I have to get on. It's, I have to be green. I have to get on this. It's going up. And so they'll buy it right there. And next thing you know, it pulls back a little bit. Average Joe panics, and they take a loss. And now it's coming back again. Oh, it's a breakout. Maybe it's a false break, you know, just 2 or 3 pips better than before, before coming back again, right? This is Chop C, break, break, break. Eventually, the real break happens. Average Joe thinks it's going to the moon. It's only going 1 standard deviation away, maybe 2. But eventually it's coming back. Right? So We trade preemptively. Right? We are The confirmation that everybody else is waiting for. Right? When that breakout happened, a lot of folks said, oh, not, not yet. I have to wait for confirmation, right? They're waiting for this. We are delivering it to them. Does that make sense? It it really is. You and I being at the table and not on the menu, right? We deliver. What they're looking for. Somebody wants to, you know, buy up here because of fear of missing out. We will sell it to you. You want to buy at the top? Sure, we will sell it to you. Right. Eventually you and I may be wrong. That's OK, because we know what to do. We'll average out. Right? Average out. And so, understanding that next move, and it's unlikely outcome, the moon. All of a sudden, panic goes out the window. Right? Nothing is running amok. Things are just Very average from day to day. Especially if you make it a point to avoid news events. Right, the news event is what kills. Uh, the unaware. Uh, average Joe sees it as a potential lottery, you know, I can pay off my truck if I get the FOMC right. At the same time, uh, it could cost you your truck. Right, so, just because the chart looks really really good. I've come to believe it's a trap. Right? When it's too good to be true, it really is. And so when we see stuff like this, remember that somebody is on the other side. And that somebody is highly likely been around longer than you. Right? So, just because it's going up does not necessarily make it a buy. Right? And at the same time, just because you're in a pullback, Does not always make it a sell, right? Sometimes it's worth buying the pullback. To get what you're looking for. Right? So it every day is a different uh Set of circumstances, but we're there with our tool bag, and we only have 16 clicks, and over time you get more and more experienced with those 16 clicks, right? And the market's ability to trick us is never ending. Like it comes up with a new trick. At least once a week, something I've never seen before. And I've been doing this particular method for well over 8 years now. It's a It's uncanny how the unfolding of the candles, how the candles are actually evolving. tricks us into changing our mind on the fly. The boxes allow you to remain committed. Right? The boxes allow you to remain steadfast in what you believe. Is the outcome, right? The next move. Right? So it's OK to play backwards. It's OK to play counter trend, but know that this will eventually lead to a failure, right? You're gonna be stuck holding the bag when the market resumes. In the direction of the trend. Uh, you've heard me say this before. Oops, sorry. Uh, the tide lifts all the boats. And so we don't wanna get caught with our pants down. Literally, you don't want to be selling this in an uptrend. Right? The one time you'll see us do this selling is when we have exceeded the ADR. The average day, right? So there's an unlikeliness of going further. Unlikelihood of going further. Right, so it's the probability that we're trading. We, we're not seeking to Confirmation. We are literally trading before the event happens. We're forecasting something. And that's something is not far into the future. It's within one standard deviation. This is where our money comes from. Right, so our money comes, our potential average yield, right? PAY. That comes from within your arm's lengths. Well, everybody else is trying to make their money. You know, with trades that end miles away. We make all of our money within arm's length. Our our decision making. Is uh. Uh, well exercised. You know, it's not like we make one decision per day, like one trade. Per day Right, we're doing 50, 60, maybe more, maybe less. Trades per day, right? There's a lot of decision making that happens there. You're burning a ton of calories just sitting there clicking your mouse. And because you're achieving a greater rate of success than ever before, Anxiety slowly goes away, right? So now you're, you have tons of time to be on the lookout for those two trades out of 100. That can wait wipe out a week of work. Right, so it's up to us, the risk managers. To not let those two trades slip through your fingers. Right, we have a lot more control than you imagine. And then you've been told about. And you've yet to experience some of this stuff, right? So, for sure, for sure, for sure, operate in a demo account. Until you have the mathematics figured out, right? Until you have your poop in a group. Once you have the math figured out, know your sizing and what it involves on the winning side, and what it involves on the losing side. And once you have that sorted, Trying to learn to trade while making 3 pips is not a bad idea. You can, you can. Earn 3 Pips in a live account. Provided you kind of commit to the end of your trading session every day. Right, there's a time when you have to stop clicking your mouse. Whether the trades remain open for another hour, that's something else, but you're no longer opening more trades. That's the key, right? Whatever you're not doing anymore is not going to cause you grief. OK, so there's a start, there's a stop. Like I mentioned yesterday, it's similar to running a restaurant for rush hour, and that's it. And you don't care about the other. You know, 21 hours of the day. You're only here to run the restaurant for 3 hours, that's it. It's the same kind of idea, right? There's the best time to trade, and then there's everything else. And our system allows us A recovery method or a methodology of, you know, fixing what doesn't go well. So we don't immediately throw in the towel when things go backwards. We're, we're prompted to try something else. We're prompted to, you know, try the next trick in our bag of tricks, and you have space to operate within. Space to everybody else is extremely scary. To us, it's, it's a safe space, right? It's statistically proven that within this 36 Bips, we can make more than enough money each day. Right, it's up to us to limit the damage when things go backwards. It's not up to the market. It's up to us, the operator. Right? And that set operator fulfills two tasks, right? You have the trader on the opening of the trades, and then you have the risk manager on the closing of the trades, two different psychologies. two different Reasons for being. All right, so understanding what you're here for is only part of the challenge. The other thing, uh, that you're gonna be compelled. To do is to Overdeliver, right? That's kind of what we're trained to do in real life, you know, work overtime, you work an extra 15 minutes and don't charge the boss for it, you know, where society has us answering our cell phones now, when it's business calling. I remember 20 years ago, my boss would have to pay me to answer my cell phone because the cell phone was so expensive. Right, all of a sudden it's become. Common practice. Right? So, don't overdo it. When it comes to trading, less is more, right? Just fulfill your average, do what you're capable of. Even if it's a 0.25% per day. You're changing your life. You may not even realize it, but it's more than average Joe down the street. is accomplishing, right? Joe down the street, he's incapable of stopping over trading. He's working 18 hours a day trying to be the best loser he can be. And it's not getting him anywhere, right? We are operating with limits. To be the best loser we can be. And it's delivering a very different outcome. Right, so 5% a month is life changing. There's not a bank on the planet that will give you this. That's 80% per year, if you compound that. Right? So that's only half the problem. That's the first half, like, get good at making 0.25% per day. At least. I just start there. If you get to 0.5%, most people out there are trying to achieve 1% per day without knowing how to get to 0.25% 1st. Right, they're putting the cart before the horse. Start small, achieve consistency. Earn the right to grow. And this right here will grow by itself. I earned the right to change your size, and that's only because the equity has grown. Right, so it's, it's a feedback loop. And we're trying to close that feedback loop. Through a sample, right? thousands of trades instead of one or two, hopefully really, really lucky ones. Right, so we're learning to trade each time you're clicking your mouse. Right? There's a probability of success attached to that click. That's why you clicked. And if it doesn't work, it's about to teach you something. And if you see it as a lesson and not a loss. You're in this for the next 20 years. Right, it is the market. Uh Proving your thesis. It's not proving your worth, right? So don't take stuff personally. It's just mathematics. You have to disassociate from the value of your click. Imagine when you're trading a large enough account where losses are worth, you know, a small house. The psychology is the same. Right, it's just you're operating. Uh, piece of equipment, or you're operating a process, you're running a process. You've earned the right to lose a small house. That sounds stupid, right? But you've earned that right. You, you weren't just plucked there at the top of the food chain. Right, you started by trading mini lots. And that's the key, right? Baby steps. Remember those baby steps we talked about? Right? This is really the key, and this took me 10 years to figure out. I, me personally, I was one of those guys putting the cart before the horse, and I was also one of those guys that never could admit psychology had to be part of my Learning process. I had no psychology problem. I had never failed at anything in life. I, I was successful at everything I accomplished, I touched until I met Mr. Market, right? It wiped me clean. And then I had no choice, right, but to figure it out the right way. And so, literally, the right way is Like we learned to walk, baby steps, and then with baby steps you can run marathons. Right, it's not, it's not fair to you. To put things out of sequence. Like it's Think of it as learning to trade, as crossing a river, and you're faced with stepping stones. We are all faced with the same stepping stones, risk management, money management, some kind of a strategy, and one of those stepping stones is the psychology. 99% of us are trying to skip over that stone. And while the facts are we should spend most time on that particular pebble. Right, because that's where all the problems come from. Right, I can teach you math, I can teach you the structure, I can teach you all that stuff, but I cannot teach you about you. You have to figure that out on your own. And so it's your upbringing with money, your needs for money right now, your view of money right now, your view of the world right now, all that stuff will have an impact on the outcome you're trying to achieve, right? So, Uh, Lower the bar, right? Make it achievable, make it repeatable, make it consistent. You'll go back to swing trading at some point, you will see the potential for swings. But start by booking. Achievable Consistent winds. That's good for your psyche. Right? Turn the table around, start to win. While learning to lose, right? And things will be very, very different from you going forward. And so when things go wrong with our box methodology, no, you don't have to fight for boxes' worth. If you're not convinced that your bias is good. Say enough is enough before you go into box number 3. So right away, your losses will be half as bad as what they could be. Right, 18 5s instead of 36. And there's only going to be 8 clicks instead of 16. Right, so there's ways to mitigate the damage. Uh, it's all about learning to drop the shovel when we're digging a hole, right? Most of us don't know that we're digging a hole, and we don't know what shovel. We don't know when to drop it, how to drop it, all that stuff, right? So it's Trial and error for 99% of the folks out there. You can shave a few years off by, you know, Not repeating my mistakes. All right, so I'm gonna let you guys go here. Uh, hopefully this was recorded cause I'm not repeating it and uh we'll make use of the information, you know, as we go along. Right, so in the future, don't expect. Home runs. Engineer to get to first base, and as you're going to first base, you will see the potential for these bigger moves. And while you target for these bigger moves, you can still risk. Boxes, right? 3 to 4 boxes of risk in order to make 3 to 4 boxes of gains. And that's one way to approach it. Right? Aside from that, 3 pips, 3 pips, 3 pips is your salvation until you get your poop in a group. All right, ladies and gents, I'll let you go and uh good luck. All right, thank you for, thank you everybody for joining today, and yes, this was recorded, so also rewatch it. Awesome. All right, thanks everybody. Thank you, bye bye.


## 14 2025 March - Navigating alternative Time Frames and Instruments for Scalping aac

All right, hello and welcome everybody. Today is Wednesday, March 19th. We have our 8th monthly mastery call. Um, today's topic is other time frames and instruments. So we're all very excited to hear more about that. Jean Francois, over to you. Awesome. So, welcome one and all. Uh, it is March 19th, it is 10 o'clock Eastern. It is FOMC Day, and so I will look at the market just briefly with with everyone once everybody is in in the room. And then we'll, we'll move on and touch on the topic of the day. I'm sure everybody is curious as to the FOMC and, you know, what we're expected to be doing here. And so my trades from yesterday or the day before worked out properly. The hedge trade ended up closing on its own at break even plus a PI. I was hedged just for a little while. Uh, everything else came uh came home pro you know, properly as expected. Uh, the rest of it, as far as the FOMC is concerned, I've put into the chat room already, just while everybody else is still coming into the room. Uh, I've suggested earlier in, in the Slack group, if we find our way down here, which is about 36 pips away from the time I posted, we were at the top of that red candle, about 36 pips away. I want to be buying, buying, buying, buying, buying, buying, buying on the way down here, right? So, figure out a way to spread your 16 clicks between here and there, maybe you spending trades. If they get triggered, they get triggered. If not, they don't, right? And ideally, with the FOMC considering what's underway, considering what Powell is faced with, and what, you know, what's been taking place in the general markets. We would suspect a breach of the upper trend line. Right, maybe 3 to 4 boxes, maybe a pullback, right? We want to be bullish. Hence the idea of buying when it's cheap, cheap, cheap, cheap, cheap, provided we stay inside of the trend line, right? So, figure out a way to spend your 16 clicks. Expect a break at the top. All right? And then a break is not going to go to the moon, right? We'll have pullbacks and so on and so forth. We're just here for, you know, a couple hours per day. You may not even be dealing with the FOMC, right? You may be coming tomorrow to do your two hours somewhere up here or somewhere down here. Right. So today's FOMC should create the environment that breaches this pattern, and then we're trading thereafter. OK? So that's for the plan for you guys that are trading. Uh, today's topic, however, was more Towards my whiteboard, leaning into my whiteboard, I should say. Uh, we've all, we all know about the creation of the boxes, right? How we need a sample. We're looking at approximately 20 is a good number to sample, right? So if you can get 20 days of data or 20 sessions of data, right, and average that together, it's a good place to start, right? And we do that. On any instrument, on any time frame. So you can pick any pair that you want at any moment, figure out a quick dirty box, and trade that box, right? It's dirty math. It's an average. It doesn't have to have, you know, 6 digits of precision, right? You're not looking for deadly accuracy, you just want to know a dirty average so that you're aware what the market's potential average yield is. Right, so keep that word in mind, PAY, right? So with that potential average yield, we know how to create it. We know how to get to that number, right? All of you guys that have gone through the course. Uh, you know, uh, contact, have had the opportunity to create your own box on whatever time frame or time zone that you're faced with, right? So you've had the opportunity to go through this process. It's, it's as simple as it gets, right? It doesn't get any simpler than this. We just want a big enough sample. And so, if this was a two hour window, we would want to repeat this 20 some odd times, right? We want to be able to have a large sample that's reliable. So that's rule number one. Right, you want to apply Bayes' theorem. To this new instrument that you're looking at trading and on that new time frame that you're thinking about, right? So this will be the first thing that you're gonna be faced with, figuring out the average. You're probably asking on what pair, right? So this is where correlations have to come in. Because if you're now going to be, you know, blending your pool of monies across different instruments, right? So you maybe you're trading a little bit of euros and you may be also trading the pound. And you have USD in your account? Right? If you're trading both euros and pounds, 1% of euro is not the same as 1% of pounds. Right? So you have to allocate the money appropriately, right? The money management has to come in. Right? So, before you even go down that path, are you sure you want to trade that 2nd instrument or a 3rd or 4th? Are you sure you want to be adding to your universe, right? Because unknowingly, you may be adding to the risk all on the same side of the equation, right? You may be betting against the US using gold, using euros, all for that moment in time. Right? And so you have to understand what's kind of intertwined and what is Uh Not so correlated, right? So, for example, if you're looking at A lot of you guys in the Asia Pacific part of the world look at gold. Look at the the the USD. Um, Look at the USD as a anti-gold, or gold as an anti-USD, right? They're working opposite to each other, and that's pushing and pulling on the Aussie, the New Zealand, and then you have this correlation here that we can speak about, uh, I think it's right over here somewhere. Right here, right? So that 25% I think has changed, but there's a portion of the Swiss franc that's physically correlated to gold. Right? So if gold is moving, the Swiss franc will move. There's all these interconnected correlations that we have to be aware of. And when we're trading our little boxes, A move on the New Zealand dollar should not impact your Aussie dollar, right? We don't typically see that, but a move on gold may impact both of them, and then you're sitting there wondering or scratching your head wondering what just happened. Right, so in today's environment, we have to have our, our ear on the track. We have to be listening on what's coming up, but if you're now Introducing more items into your universe, you have to have more fingers in more pots, right? You have to have More tentacles out there, right? This information gathering mission that you're on becomes that much more complicated. Right, so I think I've shared this in the Slack group before. It may be in the file section. If it's not there, I've shared my entire whiteboard as a zip file, so, uh, maybe I can upload it again after we're done here. Yeah, ideally you want to be aware of what's Kind of pushing and pulling on your main bread and butter. Right, so if I'm trading the Euro USD for 3 pips, 3 pips, 3 pips. I have a pretty good idea. I'm keeping an eye, at least on one of my monitors. I have commodities. I have equities. I'm looking at the correlations. Not to trade them, but to be aware of what's doing the damage to my instrument, like who's pushing and who's pulling on what I'm trying to do. Right? So that's the first kind of thing you have to think of when you're going to add to your universe. Right? And then consider the the monies that you have funded your account with. Right, so if you live in the UK you probably have pounds in your account. And if you're trading the Euro USD. That 1% that goes into box number 1. It is different for you than it is for me, who may have Canadian dollars in my account. Right, so you have to use a calculator, you have to use, you know, the proper tools, you have to tell. The proper instrument, you know, what it is you're trying to accomplish. You'll notice it it changes drastically. You may not even have 16 clicks to trade with. And depending on what instrument you're operating from. Right, if you live in Australia, right, it will change the number of clicks that you have access to compared to me that may have Canadian dollars in my account. Right? And so this is the second criteria, right? A lot of this stuff is individual, right? It's, it's geared to the individual. It's, this is where the freedom of the strategy comes in. Right, so the money management is just a piece of it. The risk management has to have room in there for correlations. Right, and then from the correlations part of the equation we touched on a minute ago. If you're just looking at currencies that are correlated, or you're looking for currencies that are correlated, there are tools for this, right, like this one here in particular, I refer to Mata all the time, all of you guys should be aware of this website, you should have it bookmarked. Right, if you go into here. Something like the Euro CAD is 96% correlated to the Euro USD. On a day like today, right? And if we look It's telling you this is daily. Right? So we're looking at correlations or we're looking at avoiding correlations, right? So maybe you want something that is not correlated at all. Opposite end of the spectrum. Right? And so understanding where you lay in this grid, once you start operating with more than one instrument is critical. Right? And so, if you're thinking about multiplying your universe, I tried that, and I did it with robots, right? I've created an EA that worked with the Euro USD and then I used that same logic, that same code, and I applied it to a whole bunch of different instruments. Uh. This is what it looked like here. 27 pairs. I allocated a certain amount of money to all the pairs, and then after a little while, you end up with a really, really good stack of winners on top of each other. There's thousands of trades here, and then you have a few stragglers that cost thousands of dollars, right? So, this took years. To run through this experiment, and only to figure out that some of the pairs were better than others. And so when I replicated this, uh, this test, I did it the second time around. With uh Link existing. Oh, I did it the second time around with only the winning trades, the ones that were up at the top. How did I get myself into this? This is Darwin. OK, log out. The 2nd time that I did it, I did it with fewer trades. Uh, sorry, fewer pairs, half as many. And so I went from 27 or 28 down to 16 or 17. You'll see it here. And all I was trying to do is remove the correlations, try to get away from trading correlated assets. Right, so here I ended up running fewer pairs, more money allocated to the fewer pairs that remain, right? Similar consistency, similar progress, everything is very, very logical and tied in, and yet I'm still running into problems. Right, so by the time I did this a 3rd time around, I was left with about 9 or 87 or 8 pairs. Right, so only the best of the best of the best. Basically, I was left with the majors. And so that led me to believe that I'm OK just trading the USD. Right? So it led me back to where I started from. I spent 2 years trying to figure out what pair would be more beneficial, only to find out the euro is good enough. And that's for me, right? It may not be for you, maybe for you where you're located in your time zone with whatever you have in mind. You know, whatever it is you're trying to accomplish, maybe you're trading the Swiss yen. Right? And so it has its potential average yield. If that if that doesn't satisfy your requirements, this is where you may be led into adding one more pair, right, or 2 more pairs or 3 more pairs. You don't have to have all of the pairs in your line of sight, right? That's what I started with. Originally Only to realize some pairs are just not even worth addressing. Right? So it's worth testing stuff out. It's worth trying to understand. Where the where the biggest bang for the buck is. Right, and then because we're We're targeting such a low low bar, we have to keep an eye on costs. And so, me, I'm, I'm putting through a lot of trades. Cost is a huge impact to my throughput, right? But if you're just putting your average number of trades per day, you can account for that cost as a cost of doing business. You can make it part of the equation. Right, 20 trades per day, each trade costs me so many pennies on the dollar or whatever, and you can accommodate for that, right? So when I'm running something like this, cost becomes an issue because I don't know where or when the next trade will open, I don't know how much or how big of a cost it will be, right? So all of this stuff comes into play. And all we're trying to give you guys are the clues so that you can learn how to lose. On your terms, right? So, finding yourself, uh, correlated, you know, if you're unknowingly are heavy, heavy, short the US dollar because you've been trading against it with three different pairs. That's something that should be right there in front of you, right? That risk should be highlighted, it should be right there in front of you. If the poop hits the fan, it's really going to hurt. X3, right, x 3. Right? Because everything you're doing is against the US dollar. Hence, this, this correlation matrix is really, really useful. Right? And then you can also find a different kind of correlation on a different time frame. And so for some of you, you may never have to consider this. Right, if you just limit yourself to your 2 hour window and your 1 instrument. None of this applies, right? It's, this is really applicable to the people that Have the idea that more than one instrument is necessary to make money. Give it a shot, right? Operate within this matrix and give it a shot. You'll find out. That if you're trying to be a discretionary trader, one instrument is all you need. Right, you can experiment, you can go beyond that. As a swing trader, you will be forced to use more than one instrument. There's nothing wrong with that, right? It's just not what I was looking for. And so I spent a lot of time kind of studying what the euro is capable of, potential average yield. And I focus my efforts at a specific window of opportunity, the same window of opportunity, each and every day. And you'll notice for me it's always slowing momentum. Right? So if I start on schedule and I trade my normal amount of time, I tend to experience slowing momentum. The bars are shrinking. It's very rare that I'm faced with a runaway train. Right? So that's one of those elements that controls risk. Right? If you have to know where you fit on here, and based on the instrument you're trading, what kind of impact it may have on your expectations. Right? Something like, uh, if you're trading in in Asia, you know, something with the yen in it, I'd like to see the Aussie yen, something like that. Right? It's increasing volatility in the Asia session. And then it's kind of steady. For a few hours and then it increases again. Before slowing down into the clothes. Right, so you can see yourself operating maybe in a decreasing volatility, or maybe you're operating with increasing volatility. And that will Um, Drive your adaptation, right? It will drive how you maneuver the boxes, but you would expect. From the number of boxes, right? Are you expecting pullbacks and retracements, or are you expecting expansions, breakouts? Right, your expectations have a lot to do with when you show up for work. Right, if you're just randomizing your trades. You may be sitting on that, unable to reuse that money for anything else, for, you know, 89, 10 hours. If you're OK with that, that's OK, right? But for some of us, you know, I wanna be accountable to my throughput, right? I'm Uh, what's the word I'm looking for? Potential average yield is kind of what I'm hoping to maximize. And so, if I can see an opportunity, the opportunist in me takes it. That may be a swing tree. I'm still going to focus on doing my 3 pips, 3 pips, 3 pips in my 2 hour window. OK, so the The crossover is really a correlation that you have to keep an eye on, right? Depending on where you live and what time zone you operate on, if you're doing the 3 pips, 3 pips, 3 pips, and only the 3 pips stuff, correlation is what's going to kill you. Right? So if you venture out with multiple pairs, The correlation between those multiple pairs, or lack thereof, right? Maybe uh the breaking point for this strategy. Right, so that's the important factor, right? We are expecting to survive 3 to 4 standard deviations. On the Euro USD, right? But the minute you look at something else, you may be looking at, you know, 56 standard deviations for an average move, I pull back, and all of a sudden, the money is split up very, very differently. You can't just be doing 3 pips, 3 pips. On two different instruments at the same time using the same pool of money under The same circumstance, it's never going to happen. Right, so it's either you become a specialist. And then you have a few extra tricks in your bag of tricks under certain circumstances, which is kind of what I have become, right? I trade the Euro USD and as an opportunist, I, I see, uh, I see probable traits all around me. I don't take every one of them. Right? Uh, for example, AMD, you know, just an equity, uh, a tech stock. I've been buying a tech stock pretty much all of 2025, and I do this on the side in a, you know, in a retirement type of environment. It's not day trading, right? I'm, I'm involved in a lot of different trades. Not all 3 pips, 3 pips, because at some point you understand how to lose, and you understand where to lose, and you can apply this thesis, you know, bouncing off of support, bouncing off of resistance. You can do this on pretty much anything. Right, so don't be afraid to experiment. Don't be afraid to go back and where's my whiteboard? The Bay theorem. is where you're gonna find all of the information you're looking for, right? Once you figure out the bell curve, for the time frame you're looking at, for the instrument you're looking at, make sure you adjust the currency that you're trading with. Right? Cause you don't wanna be shortchanging yourself or over committing per click. Right? So that's the next adjustment you have to do. What you're going to find is all the instruments we're working with, because we've lowered the bar so low, we, as scalpers are operating over here. Right? We don't need a big, big bounce off of support or resistance to make us money. Right? Anybody that's a swing trader or a position trader is operating somewhere in the middle of this, or at the far, far end of this. And the longer you move away from The entry And the the longer you give yourself into the future, the more stuff tends to happen in in the real world, you know, a war starts, a war ends, a new government starts, a new government ends, or an old government ends, right? So we, as scalpers operate over here where there's very little time to change stuff. We don't give the time. To to change things, right? And so you find yourself operating right here at the top of the bell curve, an extremely high win rate. Because we've lowered the bar as low as the bar can go. Right, and this will work on any time frame, on any instrument. Right? If you're just looking to pocket that first bar, if it's on the daily chart, and it's bouncing off of support, that first bar could be bouncing the whole day, right? If it's on the 1 minute chart, that first bar is 3 pips. On the daily chart, that first bar might be 60 pips, 70 pips. But that's 12 hours into the future, or sorry, 24 hours into the future, right? Depending on when you take the entry, the whole daily candle is 24 hours. A lot of stuff can happen in 24 hours. You can find yourself going all the way across the range because of geopolitical or news events or, you know, the real world. I found myself better off. Keeping a lid on things. 2 hours. Low bar, low expectations, hit the mark and repeat, repeat, repeat, repeat, repeat, repeat, right? Every one of us, male and female, we all have a marksman in us. Like we're all out to win. We're all out to hit the mark. That's how we survive. That's how we managed to eat, right, for thousands of years. We're all, uh, it's very difficult for us. Psychologically, when we missed the target. Right, so in order to kind of overcome this in this world, Instead of looking at something else to shoot, instead of looking at a different instrument to shoot at, We become uh. Focus Extra focus on the same target we had originally. Right, so it's almost Some people call it revenge, right? But we, we We see it with a different lens, right? We know the potential, we know the average moves, we know maybe that one or two trades that we just lost is because the market needs a little bit more than its normal average, right? So we're giving it the room that it takes. It's our psychology that allows us. To give it the 4 boxes as per the math. And maybe, you know, we don't quite give up just yet. Maybe it it does need a 5th box, and we understand this, we're willing to lose 4 boxes, or sorry, 4 clicks, and yet remain active in the same direction. Like, we don't have to throw in the towel. Right, so when you're trading multiple instruments that are not correlated, Maybe at different times of day, right? So you do one in the morning and one in the afternoon. Each time you show up, you're gonna have to redo your top-down analysis. And you have to reassess. What these other traders are attempting to achieve. And like, based on how much time is left in the day, based on the information we have access to. Are we at the top of the day? Are we at the bottom of the day? Right. Are we transitioning? This is what tends to happen when I show up on my schedule. Right, I tend to find myself right here. And we're usually building 16 clicks just for that move back up, or I find myself right here. Right? Recycling, recycling, recycling, recycling, and then we're done. All of this is taking place. Following these axioms. And whatever instrument you choose to look at will do the same. Right, so you can rely on recognizing these core patterns. You can rely on exploiting the axioms as a guiding light, you know, where am I in the big scheme of things, right? Am I breaking down? Is this a bunch of pullbacks? Which we expect on schedule. And for me, I expect this to end at about 8:30 every day, which is right around now, right, right around now, whatever pullback is taking place. May be coming to an end. Right, right around 8:30. We suspect whatever pullback has been taking place might be coming to an end, right? It's just over time, you come to realize that this stuff does not change all that much from day to day to day to day, it's the same story wrapped in a different wrapper. Right? And so we come to figure out. If the sample is large enough, you'll have encompassed good days, bad days, you'll have encompassed in your measurements, all sorts of different. Real life events. They're already built into your formula. They're already built into your box. Right, so by looking at a big enough sample in the past, you've already looked at one FOMC, you've already looked at, you know, one of everything. More or less, right? You may have missed the beginning of the war, you know, the 2005 day. That's OK, right? What you want is the bulk. Once you've got the bulk of what could happen out there and you've averaged it. Doesn't matter what instrument or what time frame. You will have found the top of the bell curve. Both in time and in price. And if the box happens to be on a, you know. A 4 hour chart. It may be 36 bits across. Right, it may be 36 bits across. And it may take a day, maybe 2 days. To get across the box. Right, in time. What will you do in those 24, 48 hours. 3 pips, 3 pips, 3 pips, or, you know, something else somewhere else, maybe a different hobby. Right, maybe your day job. And you don't have to be committed to the chart like I am. And you can figure out a time frame, you can figure out the box for that time frame. And hence the probability of going across the box is based on your bias, right? You're based on your Top-down analysis. Right, so if you have the right box, and you have it positioned on the right spot, The probabilities of going across the box. are extremely high. You can see the potential. Right, and now imagine moving this 4 hour box a couple of times. All right, this now may be Wednesday, Thursday, Friday. And you've been trading the same one or two clicks over and over and over. Every 4 or 5 hours. Right, you don't have to be. Uh, it's not like a movie set, right? It's not like Hollywood trading. This is. Docile, it's slow, it's methodical. It's almost not stressful. It's psychology, and then in reality, what you're controlling is money and risk. And because you're focusing on how and where and when things should fail, right? So, inside of this box, regardless of the time frame, you have the same behavior. If it's in your favor. You have the same behavior. If it fails, 4 times, 4 standard deviations. And you have the same behavior if you run out of time. Right? And so you understand what to do. You have plan B. You have plan C, if required. What you may not be ready for is the amount of time. Use alerts. Right? If you have to put alerts all over your chart. You know, uh, be aware of when to take, uh, take advantage, to take. It's an opportunity, right? We have to be opportunistic. And so if it presents itself, we take it. And if you have more than one instrument in your universe, you're going to be splitting your attention. And then at some point, I, I swear to cow, you will regret. Oh, I missed this one. I missed that one. I was looking over here, I was looking over there. At some point your universe is just Too big. It it interferes with what you're trying to do. Right? So I found myself becoming a specialist on purpose just so I could be better at what I do, right? And it's just me. For, for you, maybe you want to be swing trading. And maybe the 3 Pip is just a compliment to that. Right, which would be the inverse to what I'm doing, and that's perfectly fine. Just be aware, the correlation. This stuff here. Yeah, it has a much greater impact than you give it credit for. Right, and especially in today's world with tariffs and, you know, uh, ongoing wars, mayhem. Uh, gold will be a big, big, big player in the months to come. Bonds, bond yields. Right? These things here. All this stuff will play a big, big part in the months to come. It's already begun. Right, it's already started. Right, stuff like this. Imagine, I'm sure you've heard this before, right, when the risk is on or risk is off. Right, so people will look at the S&P and they'll see a red candle, and oh my God, risk is off. But people are not willing to take risk. They're they're selling and they're not buying stuff. And so when the risk is off in the US, what's the session that comes after the US, right? Who do we end the baton to? Well, there's a high, high, high. Chance, probability that the Nike will be risked off as well, right? And who do they hand the baton to? Right? And so it, it's a cycle, it's a 24 hour cycle. But we're so hyper focused on here and now that we forget how this works. Right, so by the time we come back tomorrow morning and look at the Dow. Danike. And the DAX will have reacted to yesterday's Dow. Right, so by the time we come to today's, it's a whole new cycle again. We're gonna hand it off to the Europeans and the Asians at the end of the day, right? So, imagine whatever it is you're doing. Comes from somewhere. And it's heading somewhere, and you're just here for a tiny slice of this. Our brain has the ability to run away to the moon. We don't want anything to do with that runaway mindset. Right, so correlation will be your downfall if you start going, if you start adding things to your universe, to your portfolio. Right, so you have to be extremely aware of what's pushing and pulling on the stuff you're trying to do, OK? And then the box itself, we figured out, you know, a good sample is about 20 days of data. More than that really doesn't help, you know, it's just making extra work. Less than that. You don't really cover a lot of ground, right? You, you're, you want to cover a month's worth of opportunities, different news events, different stuff that takes place. On the calendar, right? It's, it's circadian. So if you can cover about a month of data on whatever instrument you're looking at, you're covering the FOMC, the end, you know, uh, you're covering the PPI, the CPI, you're covering it all. You don't have to get much better than that, right? For an average. And then what you do within this average has An impact, uh. Spe especially if, you know, if you're funded with something else other than USDs. Right? Most of the books, most of the stuff you read, everything you see, everything I do is mostly done in US dollars. And you may have pounds in your account, right? If you may have Aussie dollars in your account. And then you're wondering why things are not jiving. All right, so my 16 clicks are because of US dollars. Right, you, if you have Aussie dollars, your 16 click may become 14 click, or maybe 17 clicks, right? So I figure out exactly where the differences lie between what I do and what you're trying to achieve with that other pair, right, with Other pair, other time frame. Uh, if you have pounds in your account, and you're risking 1%, and you have a 36ip stop, maybe you have $25,000 or $250,000 in the account. You have to put in the current price, right? So, the current price right now is 129.69. 1.29 69. Right, so right away you're allowed 9 lots, but if you change to Aussie dollars, It's gonna ask you for the Aussie rate, so we'll put in the Aussie rate, which is 0.6334. 0.6334. And now you can only trade 4 lots. Same accounts, same criterias, same everything, but different funding. All right, so the number of clicks is drastically different. And if I have Canadian dollars in that same account under those same circumstances, with today's environment, the dollar is 1.43 ops, sorry, 1.43. 186. I got 4.8 lots. Right, so this is where the problem is. Right, it's not with our calculations, it's not with our thesis, it's not with how the market behaves. It's with our money management. Right, it's with our risk management. We have all of the best intentions. We can create Plan A. We can create Plan B. But then we blame ourselves for the bad execution, when in reality, we did not pay enough attention to the the minutiae. Right, there's a big, big, big difference between this. And if I was to move across the pond and put pounds in my account under the same circumstances, I have a very, very different. Ability to maneuver, right? I, I find myself limited in what I can do. Right? So, pick your poison. And figure out the minutiae. Right? Unless you're doing US dollars across everything. Things will have to change, right? You'll have to adapt. You can live in the UK or Australia or wherever and fund your account in USD. You'll make the exchange once when you fund the account, and then operate your business in US dollars. That's what I've been doing for a few years. Right? So, I only make one deposit in USD. I pay the exchange only once, and I operate the business in US dollars. I get paid in US dollars, and then once I get paid, I'd make the transfer once back into Canadian. Right? So, all of this stuff, if we're going to move away from uh Operating as a hobbyist to more towards operating as a business. This minutia is what makes the business hum, right, being aware of these little details. Silly as it sounds, changes everything to the nth degree. Right, if you live in Asia and you have yen in your account, trying to trade the euro USD. You need more than a quarter of a million dollars. Right. Uh, so Noah is asking, I want to experiment with the thesis on a high time frame. You speak about getting 20 days' worth of data on the 5 minute time frame. How many periods do you recommend to go back on the floor? Yeah, about 20 days or so, right? If you cover about a month, 20 trading days. Right? You should be able to get a pretty good sample. Right? If you, if you're not comfortable with that, increase it, right? But you'll notice if you, if you keep increasing at some point, the data doesn't change anymore. You've gone past the peak of the bell curve, now you're going down the bell curve. Right, so the first sample that you do, you know, maybe day one. It's a price and time cycle for day one for today. This was today's price and time cycle. You want to average it with the day before and the day before and the day before and the day before. Whether it's a 4 hour chart or a daily chart, you want to have at least a month worth of coverage, you know, you want to cover the PPI, the CPI, that you wanna cover it all. And in one month, we cover it all, and then the next month it's a recycling, right? So if you cover one month of data. It it it's plentiful. I'd say, you know, it's beyond a good start. Uh, in reality, what you're trying to do is capture real life. And we understand living it, real life doesn't change all that much. Right, it's people are sick of it. So it, it, this idea of the time frame. is changing your potential average yield. Right, so if you're trying to capture You know, more than 2 hours. So if you're going to your day job and maybe you're looking at trading 24 hour candles. Right, so 24 hour candles would cover a lot of ground on here, right? You cover about 8 hours of ground on here. Depending on where you start your ambition, or when, whenever you start your business every morning, that 24 hour candles might take you right into the evening. Or depending on where you live, the evening might just be the beginning, like it might be increasing in speed, right? So you have to position yourself to capture what it is you're trying to look for. OK, so there's a lot of room here, a lot of space. You have to understand this is cyclical. Right, look at, pick a different pair. Let's look at the Euro New Zealand. Right? Because it has the euro in it. It will increase in the European hours. But because it has the New Zealand in it, the Asia hours are also worthwhile. Right, the Asian hours. On the Euro USD for example, are very, very, very different, right? The Euro USD Asian session. is one box. OK, so you can position yourself and have at least an expectation. Of what the market's potential average yield is, right? And if you look to your left and you average the left on whatever time frame you choose, right, you can create a time frame, like a 3 hour chart. And average the left on the 3 hour chart. Trade the future on the same 3 hour chart using the data that you've just averaged. And you'll be fine. Right? It's understanding what it is you're averaging, right? These are average moves, day in, day out. Regardless of the time frame you choose to look at. Right? And so, even on a 3 hour chart, I would still want to be a buyer of support all the way to the trend line. Right, expecting a bounce off of the trend line like it has done twice before. Right, so we're looking for the obvious. Yes. Yeah, Greg is asking, uh, the 0.25% per trade, is it risking a 0.25% of the account if it hits the 36 Pip stock loss? The quarter is based off of the four standard deviations, which in the case of the euro is 36 peps. So, for example, if you're going to trade the yen. The box may be 12 ips over there. I'm just throwing a number up, right? So if the box is, for example, 12 5s, 4 standard deviations would put your stock loss at 48. Right, and that would be the 0.5% per box, right? This is the minutia that we have to accommodate. That's an excellent question. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, right, so if you zoom into this, you know, lower time frame. It's moving in our, it's moving in our favorite direction. And since we started talking an hour ago. Uh, you know, the world is almost at a standstill. We know what we want to do. The time frame. is a function of potential average yield. Right? And if you, if you create a time frame that nobody really else cares for or nobody else pays attention to, like a 2 hour chart, some platforms give you access to a 2 hour chart. Very few traders even bother looking at the 2 hour chart. But that's right smacking between the 1 hour and the 4 hours. That everyone has access to. And so by you having a look inside of these two time frames, the 2 hour chart. You're now you're, you're uh You're forward looking, you're, you have an advantage of looking at support or resistance before the close of the 4 hour candle. Right, a lot of traders are waiting for this candle close. They're waiting for the 4 hour candlestick to be closed. Why not step in front of that with a 2 hour candlestick? So if you figure out the box with a 2 hour candlestick. Already Using a time frame that nobody else is using, using a methodology that very few people bother with. You'd be killing it. Right? It's understand where things are falling apart. Understand where the 5th box, if you allow it, or maybe you maybe you have a a need to allow that 5th box. That's what we've been doing with Trump. Right? I've been Uh, refraining from putting trades in box number one, almost, uh, not by choice, but By, uh, now I'm forced to, I'm forced to be more patient. I find myself putting trades in box number 2. Which then survives box number 5. Right? So in this environment, we see things have changed, the box has not changed. We are adapting to the environment using the tools that we have. And you'll be doing the same thing on whatever instrument you choose, and whatever box you determine fits that time frame. Right? So it's a standard move that comes from the market. The market tells you over these last 20 days. An average swing is this many pips, and it takes me this many minutes. Or hours or days. Believe it, trust it, right? And just target it into the future. Does that make sense? There's a lot of stuff we have access to that we would otherwise, uh, you know, go down all these rabbit holes. We, we on purpose ignore a lot of that stuff, right? We're not looking at volume, we're not looking at indicators, we're not looking at uh profiles. There's a lot of stuff that people rely on that we couldn't give a crap for. We rely on the fact From the market, right? The market tells us over the last 20 days, an average swing has been this big. And if you go beyond 20 days, you know, feel free to average 100 days if you want to. You'll find at some point you've reached the top of the bell curve. Right, the box doesn't change. It's, this is the box. This is the standard deviation. OK. And so target standard deviations. Or if you're trying to scalp, like we're doing here, target within within one standard deviation. OK. Swing trading involves multiple standard deviations. And we're trying to make money within one, right? 3 pips is one bar that's bouncing inside the box. Right, so if you're operating on a 4 hour chart, you have a 4 hour box, you're trying to make at least 1 bar of profit within the box. That would be one bar. Out of the entire box, right? Maybe you're allowing it to go across the entire box and capture 3 or 4 bars. Right? So think in standard deviations, and think in bars, right? And do their mathematics in percentages and in pips. Right? PIP is price in percent, right? So it doesn't matter what instrument you look at. A pip is a pip is a pip, right? Price in percentage. So you're good to go, just go ahead and experiment, right? Feel free to give it the 4 boxes that it. Requires mathematically, we're looking at 4 boxes or less, right? Remember that 4th box. Is the top right shoulder. And we don't want to go below that, right? We don't want to go to PI 37. All right, so imagine yourself operating within the 3 boxes, and that 4th is your salvation, right? It's your last chance. And so operating in that environment, you have an upper limit, you have a lower limit. And you have so much money to spend within. OK. And so that 0.5% that Craig is asking about? It will change depending on your funding, depending on the size of the account, like all of that stuff, and it's also that same 0.25% that earns you the right. To grow bigger, right? So over time, The 25% grows bigger. That's probably the only recalculation you'll find yourself doing. You'll, you recalculate your size, more so than the box. OK, so I hope this was useful, and I'll fire questions at me in the chat box. Do it in the public forum because I get inundated with private messages and I just can't reply to everybody. And so if you do it in the public forum, then everybody benefits from the questions and the answer, and there's no silly questions. So, you know, throw that out of your mind. We're here to talk about our screw ups and mistakes and stuff. There's no shame. OK, so, uh, be willing to lose, be willing to experiment, be willing to do a little bit of legwork to figure out what your boxes. The zigzag indicator is a good tool to use. Some of you guys have programmed one that gives you the measurements, more power to you, uh, you know, but yeah, don't be afraid to goof up. And it's the only way you're gonna learn. It is, it absolutely is. You have to feel it, right? Even in the demo account, you will still feel. Targeted to some degree. It's not you, right? It's not you, it's not a reflection of you. So throw that out of the window, right? Just make mistakes, learn from those mistakes, and focus on to some degree on the minutiae, right? Make sure you've got the details figured out. Before, you know, assuming the strategy is is failed. OK, so good luck to you, uh, reach out to me if you need help. I'm more than willing to help you figure out your box, you know, um, not everybody should be trading the euro. It's not suited for everyone out there. Not everybody lives where I am doing what I'm trying to do and, you know, this kind of stuff, so. You're good to go, folks. All right, thank you everybody for joining today. See you next time. 00, just before we go, before we go, one last comment. I have a problem on moving the boxes. Yes, this is common. This is a very, very common question. It's not really a problem. It's a lack of practice, right? So start by pinning box one on the most recent swing. And add boxes from there, and you'll see yourself wanting to move them, and go ahead and move them, right? Recalculate things, re-gauge the environment under in real time, and that's the best way to come up with Plan B and Plan C. You may be forced to jump a couple of plans ahead. Right? So this is it. This is the freedom that you have. Dive right in, experiment, OK? Have fun, folks. Bye bye. Thank you. Goodbye, buddy.


## 15 2025 April - Transforming Trading Skills into a Business aac

Hello and welcome everybody. Today is our 9th monthly scalping mastery call. It is Wednesday, April 23rd, and today we're going to be talking about operating as a business and its advantages. So Jean Francois, we are very curious and um you can go ahead and get started. All right, well, welcome everyone. It is the 23rd of April. It is 10 o'clock Eastern. I'm not trading this morning. We will be reviewing, however, some of my old notes stuff from about 3 or 4 years ago, stuff that I had to go and basically review when I wanted to transition from a hobby trader into a business. And some of these notes I digitized, and so I have them here with. Me, I did that 3 or 4 years ago, but the content is some of it much older than that. And so I want to show you guys how I, uh, operating as a businessman in a trading world is really a living document. It's a living environment we're seeking consistency every step of the way. But it has to start with something which is clearly inconsistent, unknown, and uh we're starting from scratch, right? So most of us, this is just an ambition, that's what brought us here. That's why we're, you know, a hobbyist in the first place. And so when you look at it from a legal standpoint, everyone starts out as a hobbyist, trader, and from a tax per. or you're a W-2 schedule in the US and Canada, it's a different label, uh, but it is the same similar structure from a legal perspective. So you, you have your day job, you have your salary or you're, you're an hourly worker, you earn so much money, you pay your taxes on that income, and then you're left with after-tax money and let's say you choose to go buy a new computer or laptop or something, you have to spend your after-tax money. And so as a trader, this is, as a hobbyist trader, you have a way of supplementing the earnings, but the taxes steal it all back. The taxes will take it all away. And so there is a time and place when your trading is now advantageous. You can start thinking about scaling up that skill that you have, right? You can leverage, you can Put more money in, there's ways to address this, right? So, but there is a time and place where in the back of your mind you're thinking, huh, this might just be more than a hobby. And so you do want to start looking at maybe the simplest business structure you have access to, like an LLC or in Canada, that's a sole proprietorship, so something that gives you access to business. Right, from a tax perspective. And now that same $1000 in earning under a business umbrella allows you to buy your $900 computer and pay taxes on the balance, right? So you could see how very, very different things get when you go from a hobbyist to a so-called profession, right? So the label professional may or may not stick, right? just yet, but at least You have the legal structure under your foundation, you're starting out right. It is uh how much you get to keep that determines your wealth. So you're going to be competing with Mr. Taxman every step of the way. Set up the structure so that you can take advantage from day one, right? So, take a snapshot at this. This is a really, really good reminder of, you know, why we may want to approach it, OK? Uh, from a, from a tax perspective, right? Your accountant, when you do find one, will appreciate the fact that you're aware of this because it simplifies the the steps that come after gathering your receipts, having your expenses, I'll figure it out, understanding what is taxable, what is not taxable, and that kind of stuff. And so, for me, if I go back to 2013, I've Then discovered this organization called the APA Fund and at the time it was one of the original crop firms. They were offering education and ultimately you would graduate into a funded account and you would sign a contract and now you were trading their money. Now today you can rent a million dollars. So things have changed substantially in the last 12 years or so, right? But a business plan is the first step when you start thinking about operating as a business, and the API fund forced me to create this. And so they took me out of the hobby world and, and they made me a businessman. They, you know, basically. I was operating under their umbrella, right? Their, their, uh, mentorship. And so, Jasper 4X is what I became a business, right? The purpose is to trade currency, foreign exchanges, profit from temporary shifts, trends, and momentum, trades can be buying, selling, or hedging, right? The objective is to consistently Earn profits from daily trading without placing my account in undue risk, right? And the goals clearly to learn to trade several strategies with confidence and positive performance, to learn to trade price action with confidence and positive performance. Several strategies get broken up into a different slide later that I'll touch on, and that can also be broken up into multiple different slides. That we can address in the future. So my structure, business structure from a legal standpoint, is something that reflects the slide I just touched on the taxes. I'm based in Alberta. I'm a sole proprietor. I have limited liability. I pay my taxes. I have a business license because I'm located in a federal national park, I have to have licenses for that as well, just to operate a business within the park. No, I had to jump through extra hoops just to be a trader in a national park. Things that I didn't even know or considered in the first place. Keys to success, continuous trading education, this will never end. Professional approach to risk management. We optimize over time our position management, and so earning the right to grow and at the same time. Being told to shrink your size if you start to lose proper emotional control. Everybody's been experiencing some experiencing this piece over the last couple of days. So, I'm located. You know, in my home office, I'm in the Rocky Mountains, blah blah blah blah blah. Office operations, really, I'm, I'm currency trader, so I can do business at any time. So we have to choose when we do business. So I've chosen a while ago. To focus on the Euro USD and to focus on when the markets overlap, and specifically right here. So you can see how from a business plan, we're touching on a lot of different aspects of Uh, risk, culture, I'll use, you know, stuff like this, right? You can hand this document to someone else and they'll get a pretty good idea of what your business is. And so back in 2013, after I Went through their education material and stuff, as their assessment. I was officially funded with $2500 of their money, right? So this was step one of a prop firm. I, I get to trade the owner's money, right? So this was OPM, other people's money, and back then, trading other people's money was the pinnacle. Of trading. So that meant you had proven your worth. Somebody trusted you with their money. In this case, there was $2500 and from there you had to grow. Actually, if you earned $1 just $1.03 months in a row, the amount would keep on growing. So every 3 months you earned a raise up to a quarter of a million dollars. And so now if you look at the APR refund today, It's a hedge fund. Uh, OK. So the API refund started as an education environment in the last 10 years or so, it's matured into a full-fledged hedge fund. With your business plan, you have to track your expenses, tax purposes, you know, your accountant will will thank you. You document all of this stuff in the first place. You legitimize everything that you do, you're you're not. Stealing the internet from your neighbor, you're actually paying for the internet, and you get tax reimbursements for that. Back then, I was using DSL and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. My main advantage in 2013, and even today on some of my charts, like you may have noticed, I use Ihimou Kink Ohio, and it's built-in strategies, right? So that's my strategic advantage. Right, I've, I became proficient with ichimoku at the time. I've added more tools to my toolbox since then. But this was the beginning of my business. I see the attached playbook. Who is Jasper Forex competition? Who is your competition, right? As a retail trader, as a trader, retailer otherwise, you are your worst enemy. Jasper Forex's only competition is me. The market offered the same opportunities to everyone. We, the market doesn't differentiate, doesn't assign label, doesn't see color, the market doesn't care. Ego, pride, fear, greed, encountered with each and every single trade remains the most detrimental and therefore best monitored aspect. If you can't measure it, you can't control it. And you notice what we've done. We've locked down. Our target, we've locked down our take profit. We've locked down our time of day. We've locked down the instrument, we've locked down the size. We've locked down everything. This is the only thing that's left. And so, a little bit of a mantra, trading to foreign currency markets is a business, and like any other businesses, it must be treated as such, or it will fail miserably. Every day you wake up. Unemployed, and I must successfully do something about it. Whenever I sit down to trade, I must be clearheaded, healthy, free of emotional stress. If you think you're catching a cold and you took Sinuab or something, don't bother trading. If you're hungover from the day before, don't bother trading. And there's a sign over there that says, Don't do coke in the bathroom. Don't trade for wealth. Or fame, but trade for a professional career only, right? Don't try and be a superhero. If you win a trade, take the money from someone else. This, it's that zero-sum idea. Keep that in mind uh from uh Uh, Like, depending on what instruments you're trading with, maybe you're investing in the instrument of war, stuff like that. There's, there's emotional, there's a tug of war taking place there. Just be aware. If I'm to survive as a trader, I must take heed and know that I'm about no one to quit trading. Being successful is not an accident, but rather a series of calculated risks. Success can't be purchased, nor And to trust in my system and their statistics. I'm only answerables every trade I take, I'm a good loser, and my next trade is my best trade. Let me go and turn off ego and disable this entirely. I have a bunch, I don't know if you've heard, but Mr. Trump backed off on the China tariffs this morning, and so the squat box is going crazy. My signal group is going crazy. I have a whole bunch of notifications just going nuts right now. Moving on. So, you have to monitor. What you're doing, you have to track what you're doing. You have to be able to understand where the flaws may be creeping in. Something is not always obvious. So you track it over time, you see trends, you see tendencies, you may even see bad habits creeping in over time. For me, this used to be Fridays, and it's because of this kind of stuff that I realized Fridays was my worst day. You can use software to do all of this, right? This is not done manually. And then you also have to kind of keep track of your milestones. So this is a 10 year old document. It's changed a bit, quite a bit since then. This was the foundation, literally, of this right here, which is more in line with today. All right, so Jasper Forex, I did about 4 years ago have algorithmic trading running. I showed you some of this stuff before. I was running robots, multiple copies of the same robot on basically 28 pairs. I do, as I'm speaking to you right now, educate others. I have a small community. To follow me everywhere. We are running group sessions. I do one on one mentorships. I do stuff on YouTube with EXN. I do different life podcasts. Some of this stuff is paid. Some of this stuff is free, so it's an outside source of income besides trading. There's another aspect to the community too here with my local high school. I'm a help. Be establish an investment group with the high school students. And so that's something else that we can give back. That's the idea, you know, we can return, send the elevator back down. People have helped me become a trader. I want to help others become traders themselves, right? So, Jasper Forex also delivers signals, but only to the Home Office. I'm no longer allowed, you know, there's conflicts of interests and so I have to keep things to somewhat private, but the Home Office is connected to this. This discretionary trading is what Jasper Forex focuses on mostly self-funded. I run prop accounts with Forex and Analytics, API refund funded trade. And again, some of my manual work gets copied to the Home Office, right? So you can see how wanting to trade a few, well, a little while ago turned into something new, and it only started with the small LLC and a small business plan, one little strategy, and this one strategy, uh. It's me bringing in a different. This is a, let's see, this is it here. So, old old notes business plan, looks after the broker, I have a playbook. I have the algos journaling. This is the original plan that I was working, Ihimoku with a daily time frame in mind. Amarilla pivots, which I think I touched on in the past, was mostly for intraday work. And so this relates to swing trading. And then here we are every Tuesdays and Thursdays working together on range trading for reward. And way back then, my reward was only 2 pips. I was Increased it to 3, and it's operating like an insurance company, that's the why. The when is time of day. We compare apples to apples. It manages our event risk, right? What is it we're doing? What pair are we trading? For me it's one and always the same, right? Where do we get sigma from? And we're basically managing boxes, 1% per box. We exploit drawdown, draw up. Bigger boxes do apply, you know, so bigger time frame, it refers to rectangle trading. If you Google rectangle trading, you'll get a few hints from that. I boxes, one is static versus dynamic. I've referred to this before. We focus on one minute ATR. Within 5 minute levels, 9 pip levels. It's a long tail stop, the win loss is psychology, um, right? So you can see how some of this stuff evolves over time, right? It started out as a business plan for Ihimoku and then over. Time I discovered Camarilla and I was swing trading, and then I figured out how to arrange trade, and that really became the bread and butter of the business. And so one way to look at it is like a loss leader versus a profit maximizer. So if you go to McDonald's. They, they don't make much money on the burger, but they make a ton of money on the soft drinks. So this is the burger and this is the soft drink, right? So, it took me a while to figure out how to maximize the profits in the business through effective. Playbook. You know, just to show you how fluid trading can actually be, this was, this is one of my original playbooks. I wrote this down. Jeez, almost 15 years ago, you know, using MacD and Bollinger bands, there's a different approach depending on what it is you're looking for, like, what are you trying to extract from the market, and then apply a business model to that. Right, so let me stop sharing this here for a second. I just wanna make sure I have the right slide. I keep going. One second, is it this one here? Yes, and so when it's time to figure out your business identity, you have to decide on a culture, you have to Have some kind of moral or value, you know, there's a reason that you do certain things and you avoid doing others at all costs, right? So you have to set up some kind of rules. These were my very, very first set of rules. Take small losses with small size, preserves your capital. Right? Trust in yourself, trust in your stats, communicate your losses, right? Don't bottle things up. So if you have another person on your trading floor, if you trade with your spouse, or, you know, if you're transitioning from a hobby into a business, make sure your life partner is aware, because when the losses come, you need need a shoulder to cry on, and you can't be hiding this stuff, especially not as a business, right? Make amends with the losses immediately. That's part of the communication, right? Fail fast, fail cheap, fail forward. We're trying to do this within 36 pips now. Do what is easy, find what is simple. and repeat it. That became my 3 5s, 3 5s, 35s. Compound easy to achieve wins. Take responsibility, whatever happens, I'll find a way out, or grow up, no excuses. Take your losses right now, realistic optimism, willingness to face problems directly with a constant faith in victory. And this was written years ago. Uh, it was digitized in 2023, right? So, uh, what was on my next slide? I think this is it here. Uh, so you gotta focus on the future more than what is happening, you know, a minute ago or two minutes ago. Take 5. Minutes every day and think about your culture, your business in a year, 2 years, 3 years, 4 years from now, and vision your business from a positive light, you know, because business is making the right decisions, following your culture, following your values. Over and over and over and over. And part of that is to establish or level set yourself. And you've heard me say this a million times. Raise your personal standards. This is kind of uh part of that here. I wrote it down in 2021, but it's something, you know, that was, it's something that led to having To be written down. Raising dreams or goals higher and higher and higher is absolutely useless, right? I want to make $10,000 a month, or I'm gonna move that up to $20,000 a month. That serves nothing other than raise your anxiety for not meeting your goals. Instead of approaching trading from a monetary standpoint, where the goal keeps, like a carrot keeps just far enough away. Flip things around, make it so that the carrot comes closer and closer and closer. Refuse to lose more than a certain amount of money instead, which is what we've gotten accustomed to doing. 365 or less. Only do things that are simple, easy, and repeatable, right? Raise standards, not goals, like even signed it, right? So a lot of what we're doing. Takes uh ownership, you know, we have to commit. And we have to understand what we're here for. You know, primary aim in life cannot be trading. It's not sitting at the computer 24 hours a day. All right. Maybe you want more money, maybe you want more time, maybe you want better quality of life, you know, health, trading may get you those things. It has, for me. Right? But it's not my primary aim in life. And so, when did I choose to transition is when I realized the API fund was willing to fund me. I was making at least $1 per week with their money. I scaled up and I leveraged up. Uh, today, I'm operating scalps for consistency. And I trade end of week and end of month using ichioku and Camarilla pivots to boost the income, to boost my bottom line. And I've more or less given up on the robots, but it used to be part of my routine for consistency. Right? And so, minimizing risk, letting profits run, we can accomplish that with the boxes, and we can count boxes forward by allowing the market to use 4 boxes of risks. And because of that behavior, what have we done? We have now taken a skill, turned it into a business, which actually benefits from being wrong, and sometimes we can even take the wrong. And turned it into a profit. We can take our bias, go into boxes 2, go into boxes 3, go into boxes 4, and lo and behold, everything comes home and we get paid. The whole time you thought you were wrong. Is it support? Is it support? Is it support? And it keeps failing. It keeps failing. It keeps failing. Eventually you find what you're looking for and you turned a rock. into a profitable mistake. You know you're in the right range. You know you're in the right space. Most people only are willing to take one try and they give up immediately. We have a system that allows us to benefit from being wrong in the moment. It's not support. Oh, it's not support. Oh, it's not support. It's near here, right? So remember this, right? You have to have a primary aim. You have to have an opportunity worth pursuing. Otherwise don't bother, right? Unless you have a skill that makes you money, do not buy prop accounts. Once you have a skill, then you have a strategic objective to use it with. Target. Some of this comes from a book called Eyth Revisited. It's about 300 pages. It's available online, a really, really good book. And so this led me to revisiting my business plan with the API refund, the one that I had created in 20 2013. To include start time, stop time, go to the beach, right? Don't work in your underwear. If you're a male, shave, you have to have a routine, especially if you're working in your home office. This is not Surf City. You have to have a trading routine, daily, weekly, monthly, specifically around your books, your statistics, you know. Track record. When you're operating as a business, you're not doing it for free, so you have to pay yourself on schedule. So you have to pick that schedule up front ahead of time. And this is now your paycheck, right? This is your salary. When's the last time you went to your day job and your boss skipped paying you? Never. And you probably would be really upset if you did. So you'll do not consider skipping yourself from, you know, payday. You pay yourself from the balance of the account, and you choose ahead of time. Is it going to be 5%? Is it going to be 10%? Is it going to be 20%? And how often do you get paid? Or when do you get paid? I get paid on the 22nd. I, I pay myself on the 22nd of every month, and my fiscal year stops and starts in September. And so, I run a 12-month business and it stops and starts in September. And I get paid on the 22nd of every month, right? The business processes with its reports, daily, weekly, monthly, income, expenses, salary. A lot of this stuff is produced for me. So, you know, I don't track it anymore, but in the beginning, that's kind of what you have to do. You have to track all of the services that you employ. For your accounting, for your taxes, and in some cases, if you have employees, if you hire your kids to shred paper in the office and pay them a salary, give them a handbook, right? So, basically, write down your values, right, write down your code of ethics, write down your employee guidelines, your dress code, operate like a real business. It transforms. Everything that you do from there on out. And then when I was approached by the family office, I was basically, you have to prove your track record. You have to have some kind of CV, so something to show them what it is you've been doing. And then there's a legal structure that changes with a family office, right? There's conflicts of interests that come into play. There's no disclosure. A nondisclosure agreements and so a lot of this stuff is legal in nature. Yeah, so a lot of this stuff is legal in nature. We don't really have to go too deep into, you know, the lawyer side of things, but you have to understand that the more you go up in the trading food chain, the more you're gonna be in contact with lawyers and accountants right? So if you can, at the beginning, befriend a few, have a contact. List of knowledgeable people. Try to see up front, uh, you know, what kind of relationship you can have long term. Don't waste your time on the, you know, on the wrong relationships, especially in this business, because once you start to get up and up and up and up and up, at some point you'll become a general partner and you'll have limited partners invest with you and there's a legal. You know, there's a whole bunch of legal stuff in between. So, this is the part where you're operating as a trader, and you have investors, typically accredited investors, and they themselves have legal representation. They take great care of their security, their safety, their wealth, and all that stuff. And so, stuff that you go, uh, right now, you know, every day waking up thinking it's only 20 peps. That 20 pips can scale. You have no idea how much money is floating around looking for that 20 pips, right? So imagine offering the skill of capturing that 20 pips. it's there. If somebody is willing to pay you for that skill. So, I'm just showing you some of the stuff that I have from years ago, but there's a lot of little nuggets in this that you can take forward from here. Give it your own spin and see what comes of this. This is the other. This is the original playbook that I had, my Hhimoku playbook. Some of this is cut and paste from different YouTube videos back in 2013, but it basically, you know, it's a playbook to go through 5, I think there's, I think I only documented 55 trading strategies slash signals that I would want to trade if I was looking at ichimoku. On different time frames. It's very simple. No, the ins, the outs, the risk management, entry, exit, stop, placement, take profit. It's Shimulu in and of itself is a trend trading system, and it's very mechanical. And so for my psychology, this was suited for me to a T. And so once I mastered this, I went over and started playing around with Camarilla Pivotts, which became a A way of looking at ranges, and so that allowed me to cover both ranges with Camarilla pivots and Uh, ichimoku for the trend. And so, let me show you this here just real quick. I still use the same methodology today for the higher time frames. And so if I go and look at a weekly chart, I'm looking at ichimoku and pivots, same thing on the daily. And now with the daily, I have Camarilla pivots that defined specific call to actions and the Ihimoku tells me whether or not I should take that sell trade, or if I should focus only on being a buyer. And so by combining two strategies together on one chart, I can effectively cover the whole range of my playbook. I can, I don't have to have multiple profiles to cover multiple aspects of my trading. It's all here. And then if I zoom in, you know, intraday, I Just get a little bit more detail. The stuff that you and I are doing is really just a blank chart. Where did that opened up over here. Sorry. Let me bring into view. So, what you and I are usually focusing on, it's just the plain old chart. And if I have my template over here, I'll go to blank. I have my buttons, and I have my ADR. And if you can see the two little purple dots on the chart, two little purple dots. Show me where the 3 pips in front and the 3 pips behind is. And this is what I usually use for MT4. So we have our consistent bread and butter, 3 peps, 3 peps, 3 peps, 3 peps, stop, supplemented with once in a while, intraday swings once in a while, weekly or daily swing trips. And so it really is a restaurant with a menu. I happen to Be the only employee, right? But there used to be robots. I used to be managing those robots as employees, and every day I would allocate more money to one and taking that money from the losing robot. So I, I would be rebalancing their workload based on their performance. And so that became just too much of a hassle for me to stop that aspect of the business, but it is an evolution. Right, you have to be willing to start with something that's good enough. And just make it better every day. And so if you can make $1 per week, I can teach you how to scale it up. You can teach yourself how to scale it up. It's the consistency that's more important. Can you keep that $1 that you make? If the answer is no, don't bother. If you can make $1 per week and you can keep it, you can grow your business and legally, You know, uh, there's tax implications to benefit from operating as a business, and so there's no reason to not go down that route. And now people are fast tracking everything by purchasing prop accounts. And so if you do earn income from a prop account, you're gonna give most of that to the tax man. If you operate as a business and you trade a prop account, it becomes a And the tax changes very, very differently. So make sure you have the skill first before you blow money on props. And once you have that skill and you're willing to scale, approach the prop account from a tooling mindset, right? It's just a tool in my business and approach the taxes appropriately. OK? So, if you have any questions, I guess now would be the time. I'm kind of running out of material. No questions. Yeah, EI revisited. Yeah, that's the book right there. What is Algo Nation? No Algo Nation. Oh, this is with Desire to trade. Actually, Etien and I met, uh, through YouTube. Literally. I commented on one of his very first videos, uh, I think it was like his 42nd video. I just made a comment and he replied, and I became an interviewee number 68. And then Our relationship just began from there. I went on my own way doing my own thing. He went on his own way doing his own thing. And then just this last June, July, did we choose to do this together. And so, no, I didn't even know he was running robots and stuff. When would I transition? Uh, this would have been about 2018. It's not really a transition, just really spent a, I started focusing more on one versus the other. I still do. Ichimou, but now instead of just sitting here staring at a 4 hour chart, I fill my time on the 1 minute chart, making 3 peps. So a lot of that stuff you hear me talk about in the morning when I'm looking at other things or you see my mouse move off the screen, it's because I'm managing these other traits. And because of conflicts of interest, there's a lot of stuff I can't show you, like the sizing, the position. and this kind of stuff. Uh the expenses each month can vary. You can use a Reuter terminal, that's a couple 100 bucks a month, but you can have your internet, or you can have the portion of your own office. There's, there's a whole host of things, but at some point it does settle and when you stop acquiring new expenses. For a while, I had magazine subscriptions, commodities, futures and commodities. So yeah, there's, you know, after a bit, it settles, but much like any other business. How much time do I spend on Futurist trading? It's really more of, uh, going to Vegas kind of thing. My futures trading is usually done in the evening. Sometimes I'll do it in the morning if there's something peculiar happening, something worth looking at. But no, for me, my money comes from Forex, and if I do trade futures, it's having a, you know, the casino. And what type of business? Yeah, like that. How do you manage losses? How do you manage losses emotionally if you only work with paper trading? That's a good one. The paper trading is because of these conflicts of interest. A lot of the stuff that you see me do with Crader, you'll notice there's a copy function built in, and so some of those trades do get copied over. The paper trading is because I'm not legally allowed to show you what I'm working with. But no, it's the same no matter what. There is no. Difference between one versus the other. Once you understand the impact of your emotional toll, some people blame leverage, some people blame the broker, some people blame the market. Bullshit. It's all you. Everything you do is you. The market doesn't know you even exist, right? So, yeah, the, the problem, people put too much emphasis on it's live money and then they kind of get thrown off the horse. It's a donkey. It's, right? And so the problem is. In your mind, usually between your ears, and it will dissipate if you just focus on consistency. You can put a piece of tape at the top there where it says live and just trade the exact same thing. This is why when the prop account transitions you from the assessment to the so-called live account, you want live money. You don't want to be trading a prop on their terms forever in a demo, right? Forex and Nalvix. Transitions you into live $250 or a million dollars or whatever you choose. You're trading a live account and you get paid your live returns, which I've posted in the group a couple of times, right? So, if you're looking for live prop, they're out there. But you have to prove yourself in the demo first, right? And so this right here. Right. This started out with nothing, and because of this, because of this, this has grown substantially to the point where I could actually attract something like that, right? So it's, you have to start with nothing, you have to create a track record, whether in demo or in a live account, at least prove it to yourself, right? Before you put live money in your self-funded account, right? Prove it to yourself. That's the key. In that transition, the demo account is really to try stuff out. Once you know it works, go to live. And so I have a dozen or so demo accounts and I have a dozen or so live accounts. I have the futures trading is all prop. I don't have my own futures account. I don't have a funded, self-funded futures account. I use either Lilu or Trade Day, but yeah, it's, there's a Million ways to address the acquiring of the funds. It's just in these last 5 years or so, someone had the bright idea of putting the cart before the horse, and now you can buy access to funds without proving your skill set, and that just confounded everything, right? So you have to have the skill set before you can get the funding and people are acquiring. The funding by buying it without the skill set, and they have no hope of ever creating an environment like this. UK spread betting is said to be gambling and therefore said to be tax-free. How big does your turnover need to be to increase your tax income in the corporate structure? How big does your turnover need to be to increase your after-tax income? I have no idea. You have to ask my Accountant, is personal employee tax rates very close to it? No, it's not. No, it's not. Depends. In Canada, it all depends on your income tax, like on your rate of income, and everybody is on a different schedule depending on, you know, how much money you earn. Can you say something about copy trading? Do you have separate copy accounts? Yes, yes, that's uh Lawrence is touching, that's the thing with the Home Office. I, you know, on this chart here, it's called Signals. Replicator with a K is a good tool to use. There's a few other out there. Ideally, you want to manage size through the copying, right? So I'm just a trigger, I'm just an on off switch, and the sizing, the risk management is taken care of through the software. And risk management from a different standpoint, I rotate every couple of hours. And so if I happen to have a really shitty day, like, Yesterday, right at the end of the session, it's contained to that account. So I'm not wrecking out all of accounts. Ideally, you have to have the control over sizing, over leverage, and in some cases, direction. So, yeah, like my grandma does not get the same risk as my 18 year old daughter does, but I, I'm the initiator of the trade. I do trade some stocks. I do trade some gold. I do trade some bitcoin. I, I'm in a for. If I see a trade, I'll take a trade. The strategies we employ, once you understand drawdown and where risk is, where the line is, where, you know, you can't go past this line. Once you understand the job that has to happen at that line, booking a loss, trading becomes just a job. When you're not afraid to lose anymore, when you know how to lose, it's just a regular job. You'll see trades everywhere and you're gonna take them. I'm just showing you for the sake of consistency, one way of generating income through range trading. That's just one of a bazillion, right? 3 5s, 35s, 3 pips while exploiting drawdown is just one way of turning a bad situation into a good one. Everybody is so focused on a statistical reward that is not proven on facts that they end up losing their faith in trading in general. Right, so I had to step away from that, right? When I was running the Ahimoku in the very beginning, I was getting a 66% win rate, enough to pass the APA refund assessments, but man, did I want to get better at trading. And that's how I ended up discovering intraday Camarilla pivots, and then the APA refund themselves taught me about price and time cycles, and that's where the boxes come from. So, but it all starts from um. You know, a hobby turning into a business. And at the time, the tax advantages is what really captivated me. It's like, I, I did not realize the implication of making the switch, and, you know, having a small business at home. Very, very, very different. Yeah, so going to Hillary's last question there, how do I allocate from each? This is their reason for different accounts, right? There's accounts for like uh my ID. EKR account is only for stocks. I do all of my options trading, you know, all of it. Whatever options trading I do, which is seldom, but when I do do it, it's with TD. And so I split up everything. No broker risk is not a risk that, uh, I'm really worried about anymore. There you go, Lawrence. So, yeah, when you're running a live account and you're doing it in a public forum, you have to be aware, uh, Of the legal ramifications. And so, there's reasons to have uh multiple approaches, multiple aspects to teach how to trade, you know, from different perspectives, and I guess the live account is just one that attracts a lot of people, but it's really the Pointless one, you know, it's the same price action, it's the same, the difference, it comes from the server and the load on the demo server, you may have 200,000 traders. On the live server, you may have 2000 servers or 2000 users. Right, so from a volatility when the spike comes, Sure, it's just, it makes zero difference. So, in reality, most people have the wrong worries, like leverage. A lot of folks blame leverage. I should have had it at, you know, 100 instead of 200. Yes, absolutely, right? But anything beyond that. Pointless. Settle on 50, settle on 100, settle on something, learn to operate with it, and that's it. And once you know how it works, it's no longer a fear, right? So leverage is no longer a problem, whether it's 10 to 1 or 20 to 1 or 100 to 1 leverage, right? Once you know how it works, you take it into account. All right? So I hope this was useful. Uh, there's lots of little tidbits and hints over time in there, a couple of good books and some things to think about for your progression in this career. Enjoy. Great safe everybody. We'll see you folks tomorrow morning. All right. Thank you. Thank you everybody for joining.


## 16 2025 May -Mastering Top-Down Analysis for Scalping Success aac

So yeah, I want to uh welcome everyone to our monthly mastermind call for the elite scalping group. Uh, none other than uh presented by the legendary Jean-Francois. We're gonna be talking today about uh. Wasn't Buffalo bungalow Bill also legendary, um, yeah, so they could take it both ways. But today we're gonna talk about a very interesting topic and something I'm gonna learn a little more about too, because I, I, uh, need to respect it more and that's the top-down analysis, so. Uh, you didn't come here to hear me. You came here to hear John Paul, so JF, take it away. All righty, so good morning, good afternoon, good evening. Uh, it is the 21st of May. It is 10 o'clock Eastern Time as scheduled. We're supposed to talk about top-down analysis, and as such, uh, I don't know if you can hear in the background, I think I'm closing some trades as we're, as we're just coming online. So here's a handful of trades just closing. I think now my book is clear. We can continue our discussion. So, uh, top-down analysis, uh, the reason why it's important, and the reason why we use it specifically, is because we trade intraday, right? So, intraday is almost like a speck, it's nothing. We, we mean nothing to the bigger picture. Right, we're very, very small money trading on the intermediate time frame. And so when you take a step back and you look at that bigger picture, everything happens because of, you know, supply and demand. That's one of the basic facts, right? And then on top of that, we can look at it through the lens of expansion and consolidation. Right, so it transitions from one state to the other back and forth, back and forth, right? We expand, so that's a breakout or we consolidate into the next range, waiting for the next breakout, right? So, going back to rule number one, sellers create the supply. Buyers create the demand, right? So if the demand goes up, the price goes up. If the supply goes up, Price goes down. Right, that means the demand is going down. And that can be applied to any of the time frames. So, top down means we're gonna be, we're going to be looking at one of the highest time frames first, because that's typically where bigger money tends to be. Right, so, bigger money has more control over the market. They're the ones that are creating the tide, right? They're creating the trends. They're the ones that have the ability. To turn the market. Right, so they're the ones that have the ability to create that breakout. Or that rejection. Right? So, one way to address all of this is to figure out what the richest people are trying to do, right? The ones with the most control. Once we have that intent in mind, once we understand what their coattails are trying to do, are they bullish, are they bearish, which way are we trying to ride their coattails, right? So we look at that bigger aspect first. So that would be on the daily chart, right? So for us, we look at the daily as the highest of the time frame. We could take it a step further without any issues, right? We can look at the weekly chart. But we don't That that would be too much information and since we're trading intraday. 5 daily candles is really not where we want to be, right? It's not where we want to be trading, so we'll take information from a weekly. Just the same as we take information from the daily, right? First thing we do is we want to see. Directionality trend, right? Are we going from the bottom left towards the top right on a daily scale? So let me squeeze this over here. Let's look at this over here, right, so on the daily scale, I'm on the daily. If I zoom out, I zoom out as far as I can. I put as many bars as I can. It looks to me. Like we're going from the bottom left to the top right. Right, the current price. is along this line. It'd be somewhat different if we saw something like this. Oops, sorry. That yellow line that's right there. I'm trying to recreate it, right, so, top left to the bottom right. Right, so, when I look at the chart every day, I kind of envision this crisscross in my head. I see this crisscross, and I can see where we are, which quadrant that we're in. Right, so I'm looking at this area here. As being way more bullish than along this line here. Does that make sense? So right away, I have a taste for what's happening. I have the trend in mind. And lately, I don't know if you recall our last couple of sessions, I've mentioned, we had the intermediate trend coming to an end, and we were starting to resume the dominant trend, right? We were resuming this, the dominant trend. We had to come to uh A conclusion, like we had to finish one in order to start the other, right? So, one way to figure out what's what is by using trend lines. OK? So, we will be drawing on our charts, right? So, drawing, get used to it. The more you draw, the more things become clearer, right? So, we are following the market day by day. Connecting the dots. And so if we were to just walk up today, realizing that this is driven by supply and demand. What happened these last 3 days? Demand, right? A lot of demand is showing up. And if I just compare today with yesterday, Today is still opened. It's not a closed candle yet. Yesterday is. The demand today is clearly more bullish, more in play than yesterday, right? There is way more demand today. There's very, very, very little supply. Does that make sense? Right, so the price is going up. Right, so all we're doing is comparing. What we visually can see, right? Lower, uh, higher lows and higher highs. Very, very simple. This is called a comparative analysis, right? We're comparing one day against the other. We can do this anywhere along the way, right? Understanding that what we're looking at right now is not a closed candle, right? So, from the top, from the daily perspective, We have a bullish environment that is resuming as of a couple days ago, and today specifically, is adding to this bullishness. So it's not a counter trend day. It's not going against the dominant trend like we had been for the last couple of weeks. Right? So, you can see just by comparing a day versus yesterday, you have a probability. Already sorted out, right? You're more bullish than you are bearish. And that's just by comparing two candles because of supply and demand, right? You're trying to figure out who is in control today, who has been in control is probably a better way of saying it, because this is 16 hours old. So in those last 16 hours, you're trying to figure out. The bulls clearly have been in control, right? The last 16 hours created a higher high, created a higher low. And as I'm showing up to work right now, if I zoom into this on an intraday basis, so now that's a different group of traders. Right? These are your local banks, the, you know, the money changers at the airport, right, the people that give you a a different a different exchange rate. At every minute of the day. Right? It used to be the bank would give you one rate for 24 hours, right? And then came along computers and now we're getting a, you know, if you exchange your money at the bank, you're getting a new rate every few minutes. Right? So that intraday behavior has to be looked at intraday. Right? And so the people intraday that do business intraday, it's because they're using yesterday's limits to understand where their risk is. Today Right? They're comparing their work today with the business they accomplished yesterday, right? They're doing so hour by hour. Right, so we will repeat that same kind of behavior to figure out what the intraday folks are trying to do, right? And we do that by uh by figuring out. Their recent ceiling. Their recent floor. And we assume, based on what we saw on the daily chart. Which one should give way first? Right, so from our daily chart, We saw the green line getting greener. And we're now looking at what the blue line is doing relative to the green. Right, so it's the same price action, it's the same price right now, this is the same price. Right? It's the exact same price. It's just looking different, right? So we're trying to figure out intraday, how did those last 16 hours come to be, right? And what they, what clues have they left us. Well, they left us a low right there. They left us a high right here. Right? And so if we're doing the same comparative assessment, now if we're comparing one with the other, this is an hourly scale. Compare this current hour, which still has 47 minutes to go. With the hour before, which is already closed. Higher highs and higher lows. So this adds confluence. To your top down, right? So now you have two time frames telling you the same thing, higher highs and higher lows, and here, threatening to break through the ceiling. Right? So, when we zoom into this on a 5 minute chart, assuming We're going to be testing the ceiling. We want to be looking for support and resistance inside of this known environment. In order to pick up on potential pivots. Right, so pivots are in, you know, an area where one trend ends and a new trend starts, right? But we're looking at intraday trends. So let's zoom into this on a 5 minute. And if I put enough data. I can see levels. Right, this is where demand and supply shifted in the past, likely. Supply and demand will shift at these levels again in the future, right? So supply and demand changed here. It changed here, it changed there, it changed here. Right? Basically, Supply exceeded the demand, or the demand exceeded the supply, right? It's, it's like a teeter totter, it's like a seesaw. And if you're having difficulty trying to figure out What Uh, what swings are meaningful and what's what you should ignore. Right click on your trading platform, go to your indicators, whether it's MT4 or C trader, scroll down and find what's called fractals. All right. Put fractals on your chart. Put a default of 5, cause we're looking for the most, uh, we're looking for the apex or the nadir in the last 5 bars, right? The nader is the opposite to the apex. So if I go here and I increase the size, I will be able to see it better. All right, so now we have these. Pivots, fractals, right, swing high, swing low. And as soon as we threaten one of these swings, right? We test and we break, or we test and we bounce. OK, so ideally you'll have, you know, a pivot low. Representing support, you'll have a pivot high or swing high, representing resistance. And you can do this from the daily if you want to. Right, on the daily, we are clearly moving away from this pivot. And we have yet to leave. A red dot behind. Right? This is breaking levels. This is breaking resistance. Testing resistance. You see it? Right? That red dot right here is the next one to go. Once we give way on this, this one over here will be the next one to go. OK, so if you're bewildered, where to look to your left, use fractals, and then when you're down on an hourly, same behavior happens, right? This is your ceiling. This is your floor right here. Right? One, we assume will give way before the other does. In this case, we're making higher highs, we're making higher lows. We're now assuming a high or low is forming. Right? We're green. We're leaving behind this wick right here. Right, we're forming a high or low, as we speak. The, the bias is As simple as it gets, right? Are we moving towards something, or are we moving away from something? And in this case, we're moving away from this blue dot, towards this red dot. We're doing so on 2 time frames. We're doing so on 3 time frames. This is screaming bullish. Does that make sense? Right? So by using fractals, it will simplify the it will remove a layer of the difficulties, right? So from top down, You're always asking yourself, am I moving towards resistance or towards support? Am I moving away from resistance or am I moving away from support, right? You can trade what you see because we're measuring. Facts, you know, we're comparing today. With an average. Today we've done 85. The average is, oh, I, I removed the indicator. Uh, I don't have it there. Right. The average is 100. And so we've practically, you know, for all intensive purposes, completed the average. We're missing 5 pips. Right? So by comparing comparative analysis, by comparing the facts with an average, We end up creating a probability. Of something. Something continuing or something coming to an end. Right here. Right? Something tested and bouncing before a break takes place. Right, so you can see how we're looking through a telescope, right? We're looking to the future. We're looking outward. When we're doing our top-down analysis, we're comparing with yesterday, trying to look at the end of the current day. And we're looking into the future. And because I'm working at the same time every day, my future is only 8 hours, right? I'm there's a potential of 8 hours in front of me to complete the daily candle. Those of you that are operating from Europe or the Asia Pacific Rim. You don't have 16 hours to refer to, right? That daily candle that you have is maybe only 8 hours old if you're in Europe. If it's only 4 hours old, maybe, if you're in Asia. Right? So that creates a difficulty for our top down, right? We can't assume the same bazillionaires are going to take the ball and run with it. We haven't seen them. Come near the ball yet, it's a brand new day. Right? So what you're going to have to do is refer to a 4 hour chart, right? So for those of you not in North America, You will be better served using a 4 hour chart and doing the exact same thing. Right. Compare what you've done right now to an average bar. Oh, look at that, 4 boxes. It's not a coincidence. And so you're comparing what's been done with what is maybe left to do. You're measuring where you're coming from, how many boxes has been, you know, created. The idea is to replicate the behavior. Using a 4 hour candle, right? So you're comparing highs, you're comparing the lows. In this case, we have an inside bar. It's inside of a bullish measure bar, a bullish mother candle, right? So we're expecting a bullish outcome. It may not go to the moon, because, you know, it's halfway finished. And we've already completed. That we already completed? Well, we're about 5 pips off. So maybe another 5 pips to go, right? So you can see how it's a game of deduction. We're deducing. From The facts, what we expect to be an average outcome. Right, so we're looking at in this particular case on a 4 hour chart, you have your ceiling, you have your floor. And then when you zoom into this on a one hour. Right? You can pick up on the fractals and trade those fractals as you see them, right? You'll notice on the 4 hour chart, the last fractal was a breakout. Right, it left from this little blue dot here. We had this breakout, we had this breakout. We had this breakout over here. And now we're heading towards this over here. OK, so you can see using fractals, it gives you a target, it gives you at least the next target. And it gives you an idea of where you're coming from, right? So, if you're trading with the boxes, You start stacking boxes and unstacking boxes, and then when it creates a blue dot, you would relocate the box. Right, so in theory, you have a lot more flexibility than you think. Right, and our top-down analysis is not a guarantee, right? It's just an assessment trying to tell us which way the likelihood. of something happening, right? So, see that red, that blue dot right here? We're testing support. We broke through it. Right, that's a test. You want to buy this, all right. We're testing that blue dot. Yeah Uh, where's my traits? View options, positions, orders, deal map. Quick trade buttons. Yeah that should work. OK, so Uh, again. Comparative analysis, and we're always between consolidation or expansion, right? So that ladder that you created over here. That delineates. A consolidation. And we are sitting here waiting to see. Which level will give way first, right? This little blue dot over here, or this red dot over there? And because we did our comparative analysis, and we suspect higher highs are coming, higher lows are coming, we want to be playing breakouts basically to the upside, right? We are expecting a breakout to the upside. I'm not going to be chasing it, and I'm not going to be buying it at the top. I'll be buying it on the red cheaper candles. Right, just like we did here, right? Buying at support. OK, so a lot of what you do. relies on the left. All right. Previous supply, previous demand creates these pivots, these changes, these shifts in sentiment. And these shifts get retested, these levels get retested. Right, so these fractals are based on their last 5 candles. So it requires at least 2 candles before a fractal will show up. Right, you'll notice that little blue dot showed up when we painted this orange one. Right, so it takes 5 candles to create a fractal. Uh, this is enough of a of a uh Confirmation, right? Since we're trading the probability, we don't mind jumping in while people wait for the probability. Right? We already did our comparative assessment. We have the probability on our side, hopefully. Right, so while people are waiting for a confirmation, we already made 3 pips and the confirmation will make us another 3 pips, right? We're recycling the same trait. Right? So the recycling, uh, is a big part of the moneymaking machine, right? But it's not how we escape trouble, right? Escaping trouble is really more about Determining where things go wrong, and then acting on that information, and that's these fractals coming in. To kind of save the day, right? If you can figure out ahead of time how many boxes or how many fractals you're willing to give. And then act if the price gets there, right? Do something if you go beyond that particular level. Let's put fractals on this one minute chart here. Right, fractals. One minute chart switch this back to ours. And removed the deal about it. Right, so we have this that we're moving away from. And if it remains green and gets greener, we're testing this, which we already have once. And we're heading for this. Right, so now with the fractals on this chart. It's a matter of lining up. The blues with the blues, right? So you're playing ping ping ping ping ping or pong pong pong pong pong. You don't want to be Uh, doing the opposites. Yeah, that's, that's the part that gets us stuck with our pants down, right? We get caught when that big move comes along, it's like, oh my God, what just happened? Usually because we were in a counter trend move, right? If you were trading with the trend, you typically don't have that anxiety when that big candle comes, right? Those big candles tend to move in the direction of the trend. Right, so it's just a probability. And we're trading. Uh You know, The information that the market told us, right? The market told us 9 pips is a standard move. And within that 9 pips, we're extracting a standard price and time cycle, which in our case is 3 pips, in an average bar. All right? So from uh From a Support slash resistance standpoint, right? We're no longer looking at supply and demand here, we're looking at support and resistance on the one minute chart, right? So we've transitioned from supply and demand on the higher time frames, which is very general, right? It's not accurate, that there are zones, right? They are ballpark. So we've put ourselves in the ballpark, using Simple supply and demand rules, right? Pivotts. The pivots are left behind because of supply and demands shifting. Right? And that creates these levels that we refer to as support and resistance. Right? So support is where the demand shifted. Sellers stopped selling. And buyers started buying. And that's what created that blue dot. And then when you have the red dot, it's because the buyers stopped buying and the sellers started to sell. Right? So support is below the price, always, always, always, right? Below the current price, we're going to test that blue dot right here. So we're testing support. Resistance is always above the current price. See that red dot right there? Right, so whether you're looking at these dots on the daily, or the hourly, or the one minute chart, They represent. Shifts in supply and demand. And but then because we need more accuracy than a ballpark. On a one minute chart. it represents, uh, Call to action. OK, so if we go back to this, Right, Call to action. is related to the short term trend. Right, we did our top down to figure out, are we going from the bottom left to the top right? And then once we assumed it was a bullish trend, we looked intraday. To figure out in those last 16 hours, are we near the high of the 16 hours or the low of those 16 hours? In this bullish environment. And whatever the facts are, we end up trading it uh right here with our little box, right? And we stack the boxes, and we stack the boxes, or we unstack the boxes, you know, so on and so forth. We are trading the facts. Maybe 1 to 2 hours at a time, and that's it, right? The bigger picture goes on, we only take a slice out of it, and every day we must reassess this bigger picture, right? Because at any moment we could be starting this. Right, so the next blue move might have been. Or might be the last blue move. This is what we had here. A couple days ago. Right? Right here, this was the last attempt to bounce off of this trend line. And we broke Came back, retested the brake, and off we went. Right, and by comparing one candle versus the one before, each and every day. We're keeping track of. The guys in control and what they're doing. They're the ones moving the market, right? The guys on this daily chart are taking trades today because of the way yesterday closed. Right, they're not intraday traders. They have to wait for that daily candle to be closed. They make reference to the bigger picture, right? They don't know what today will yield yet, but the way yesterday close typically will trigger an event compared to everything else that you see here, right? Today might be the trigger. And so, if today is the trigger on the daily chart, they will spend the entire day getting in, right? They'll buy, buy, buy at any price. Right, they're in it for the long haul, they're in it for days. Right, so in reality, all we're trying to do is write coattails for 2 hours. And depending on where you live, this 16 hours may only be 4 hours. It may only be, you know, maybe 8 hours old, right? But you have to compare whatever you have with what's closed. To your left, right? So if you live Asia Pacific, maybe the 4 hour candle is a good place to be. Right? Are you breaking highs? Are you breaking resistance? Or are you testing support? Well, clearly you're not testing support. Right? You want to be buying support. OK, so this kind of stuff is, uh, it's the lesser of two evils, right? That's all we're trying to figure out. We're always stuck between a rock and a hard place. It's never going to be a 100% guarantee. And so we have that willingness to be wrong. We have that willingness. To book a loss and switch. And so maybe you're expecting a bounce off of that red dot, and we got a break instead, right? So instead of a bounce, you got a break, right away, that's a call to action, right? You're expecting something and you got something else, call to action. In some cases, our call to action is to do nothing, right? Remain steadfast. In some cases, that means going to draw down. And that's because your top down tells you. The tide is one way. And you might be trying to trade in the opposite direction. Right? So it really is important, uh, Understanding that these levels are just, they're like a mattress. It's not a cement floor, right? It's not. Impossible to break through. A lot of this gives it or bounces a little bit. It's like a springboard, right? We saw that here on a few minutes ago. When we tested over here, uh, was it on the one minute chart? Yeah, right over here, right? We made lower lows, and yet we're still going higher. Right? So this is not A uh Guarantee, it's just a clue. You can visually see where previous levels were. Previous levels, previous levels. Right? So this is the kind of stuff we're relying on. We're just relying on clues from the left, but we have to start gathering the clues from the higher time frame, right? Now, if we look at this today on a weekly, so that would be the bazillionaires intraday time frame. Right, the weekly chart. On the weekly chart this week right now is screaming bullish, and we're about to get even more bullish if we break this previous candle. And then if you look at the bazillionaires's highest time frame. Right? They start their assumptions from the monthly. And what does the monthly say? Well, that is also bullish, and it's about to get even more bullish if we can break this. Right? So, from the top down, we have an inside bar, the current month is inside of the last month. By definition. It's as though nothing has taken place. We are inside a bullish candle. We must assume bullishness is taking place on the monthly scale. So then we zoom into this so-called intraday on the weekly. The weekly tells us, oh, we're breaking out of a channel or flag. Right? And we're making higher highs, we're making higher lows on a weekly, so that adds even more conviction to my bullish bias. On the daily. I'm comparing today with yesterday. And here I am entering my bullish bias. Right? And I'm picking up everybody that's selling something. Because I'll be here for days, maybe even a month or so. Right? If I'm trading the daily, I have objectives out of this world. Like, you and I will get there when we get there. Right? The guys that are trading on the daily are not sitting in front of their computer minute by minute, the way we are, right? They were brought to their computer because some alert went off. Because the daily candle yesterday closed the way they wanted it to. And so it triggered their behavior for today. Based on what they saw. For months, right? Month, week, and day. We are repeating the same behavior, right? We're trying to get in on their coattails based on what today is doing compared to yesterday. So that might be their trigger. We see this as being bullish, as being a break of the flag, and, you know, a break of consolidation, maybe. Right, an expansion. And if we are expanding, right? This was a consolidation over here. And then when it broke, it expanded into the next consolidation. Which broke to the downside into the next consolidation which is now breaking to the upside again. Right? So, this idea of top down. is really trying to sort out. Where the control is coming from, right? Who is in control of what? The guys that have the most money control the market. And they take their entries. Based off of what yesterday did. Right? They have that confirmation that they require. That confirmation was yesterday's close, which triggers their behavior to spend money today, right? The demand shows up because of this. Right? What's been happening. So now there's more and more and more demand. Right? Less and less and less supply, so the price goes up. OK, so in what we're doing is comparative analysis, at least on 2 time frames. And then if you can trade an even smaller time frame, you'll have better accuracy with your entry, right? But one last comment uh before we move on to, you know, uh something else for a minute. The, it really is a function of the exit, right? You're making your money when you close the trade. Right, so the top down analysis does not guarantee you will make money. It's only Uh, sorting out a probability. And then you end up trading in that probable direction, but it's not a for sure, right? So what we have to understand is the top down is plan A. But then you end up having 3 boxes on the side. For Plan B, Plan C, and Plan D. Because even Plan A is a range within a range, right? The market needs space to get the job done. And so if you understand where the pivots are, and you put your boxes on these pivots to start counting. You're in line with those extremes, with those, you know, swing highs and swing lows. The same way. You are, you know, cracking to to understand what should come next. Even without the boxes, you can make the same assumptions just looking at the pivots. Right? We're moving away from that blue dot, right? We're pushing upwards. We're moving towards these red dots, so we're testing resistance. That makes me a buyer of support. Right, if we're making, sorry, that's from another uh provider. So we're making higher highs, we're making higher lows, we are willing participants. Because our top down. Tells us This is trying to make higher highs and higher lows. And we don't want to go against this. Unless Unless the clues, oops sorry, I changed the wrong chart. Unless the clues tell you that, you know, the next hour or two. Offer a probable counter trend. Right? It's this hour or two, not the whole day. This is where a lot of you guys get messed up, right? You take your bias from the top. But then you're married to that bias, even though you may be faced with a pullback before the bias comes along, right, before the tide lifts your boat. This is what happened to us last Friday, or was it last Thursday? Last week sometime. The market just went way right here. The market went way beyond expectations. Uh right around here. And so I ended up losing, you know, 6, maybe 8 trades here. And then uh This was against the trend, right? The trend. Uh, I was buying, buying, buying, buying, buying, buying, buying, I was playing opposite to the trend. I was trying to pick up the beginning of this, but I was way too early. Right, so a lot of times you'll notice with your top-down analysis, you'll have the direction, right? But the timing will be off. And that's where your losses come in, right? Time cycle, not the price cycle. The time cycle is what we're studying. Right? So by studying that same 2 hours every single day, You get to see what the potential yield is. So those are the cycles repeating themselves, right? So you end up extracting a similar amount of yield every day, right? Average. And so you're not reinventing the wheel, you're just trying to extract what The market is capable of. By doing a top-down analysis, you'll notice the average days are similar. The average hours are similar, that should be about 2 boxes, and it's a little bit over, right? A 4 hour bar should be 4 boxes, and it's a little bit under. A 5 minute bar should be 9 pips, and it's a little bit under. Right? A 1 minute bar should be 3 pips, and it's a little bit over, right? And we know all of this because we trade the same 2 hours every day, and all we're trying to do is ride somebody else's coattail, right? The guys with the most control. What are they trying to do today? Right? Today might be a nothing for them. Maybe they're not doing anything because there's no trigger from yesterday. Right, so we're really just anticipating something that may or may not even come. And so we'll notice that this is really obvious days before main events like the NFB, right? The day before the NFB, the market is barely moving. Nobody's twitching a muscle, right? Those guys on the daily chart are not spending any kind of money at all, right? We and they are waiting for the news in order to maybe initiate their next position. Right, so we are riding their coattails as they are building their positions or taking their positions off. The same way we anticipate that next move, so do they, right? A lot of these folks were buying on the way down right here, because they saw that same yellow trend line that we saw. They just are not limited to 16 clicks. Right? A lot of these guys have been bullish for a long, long time, based on their top-down analysis. And you know, they include fundamentals too, right? Some of these bigger firms, they they actually have mandates where they have to vote before they can place trades. Right? So they take such large positions for such amount of times that they have a board meeting, you know, and they have to sit there and vote before they take these kinds of trades. But this is what we're doing. We're trying to read their mind, right? By looking at what they see. And trying to figure out what their behavior will be. Right, so, for some of you out there, you might be better served, or at least in the beginning, using something like ichioku. Uh, if I remove all of the junk that's on here. Right, so by using HMMokku, if you have problems figuring out trends and where you are within trends, this is probably the best tool to teach you this stuff, right? By design, Hhimuu comes with a whole bunch of preset. Trades or patterns or trade plans, there's, you know, a handful of them, and so if you see one of those checklists, Unfolding in front of your eyes, you can assimilate what the outcome would be. You can see in your mind, based on what the checklist says, this should be bullish. And so if it's bullish, you can trade that bullish bias. Uh, with the facts that you see on the one minute chart, right? So, over here, you know, we have the Chico span, it's about, you know, ready to come out of price action. We're above the cloud. We're above the taking sin, we're above the Cajun sin, we're We're positioning ourselves to go much, much, much higher, right? On the weekly, again, bouncing off the taking and, above the cloud, the cloud is bullish. Right? The Chico span is free, free of Interference, this has legs to go. Right, so we don't want to fight this. Right, so this is the kind of stuff we do, top down, right? We want to see what the The people with the most control are trying to do. And if you even go to the highest of the time frame, look at that. If that's not bullish, What is? OK, so on an hourly scale, it adds a little bit of confluence to your bias. You know, if you're here for 2 hours, 2 hourly candlesticks. If you happen to be on top of the Tain, on top of the Cajunsson, on top of the cloud, that is screaming bullish. Right, if you repeat the same thing on the 5 minute chart, you may have a little bit more interference, right? Noise. But look at this, right? The cloud is turning green, we're testing support. All right, we're testing the cajuns and if we get there. We've broken the Tainson right here. And so that is the first support that was tested. This will be the 2nd, this will be the 3rd. This will be the 4th. Right? So, with or without boxes, there's support and resistance above and below you, right? You can use fractals, you can use ichimuku and its components. You can just use your eyeballs like I tend to do. Right, uh, All of these tools are useful. But they're not 100%, right? You're, it's still just a probability. Uh, the ichimuu stuff is really for trend trading. Right, but understanding that you're only here for 2 hours, that's just a slice of the trend, right? But this is a really useful tool to understand the trend and where positioning is, right, where you are compared to the trend. Uh The next best tool to use would be Camarilla pivots. Uh, I don't have any for the sea trader platform, but I have them. I have him here. On MT4 and Camarilla pivots are these colorful lines here, just give me a second, I'll clean up the mess. All right, so these are Camarilla pivots, and you can see how they have a built-in call to action. Right, Short, long breakout, long breakout target. And here we have a long, we have a short breakout and a short breakout target. And the pivots are applied at the opening of the day, so that's the start of the Asia session, and so the lines get drawn, and they don't repaint. The lines stay where they are for 24 hours, and the price is going through the lines. And so, right here, you had 2 candles that were short. Before the breakout happened. And then over here, it says if the price gets here, play a long breakout. So long breakout and all of this was a breakout. And if you play the long breakout, you are targeting the long breakout target. Long breakout took 1234 hours to get to the target. Right? So this is a Range trading tool. All right? This is useful for creating consolidations, stuff like this. Right? So, what I have done in the past, and what I do once in a while, is I combine the two. Right, so I'll, I'll put the Camarilla pivots and the ichimou together. And so now I have a call to action, uh, let's see, one hour time frame. I have a call to action. And I have this trend superimposed. And so it's telling me bullish is the trend, and the Camarilla pivots tell me the ranges that are making up this trend. Right? So, I can understand if I'm in a pullback or if I'm into an expansion, right? Is it consolidating or is it expanding within this trend? Right? The other tools you see at the bottom, one is Williams R. Right, so that's Bill Williams, the same guy that created the fractals. Uh, this particular tool is very useful for short-term traders like us. Because it incorporates momentum as part of the equation. Right, so part of the formula looks at momentum. Which is probably one of the most forward looking indicator we have. Right? So if you're looking at momentum, you're looking into the future, or you, you're looking at the end of the current bar and what the next bar might look like. And so, let's put some Williams per R on here. Uh, where is it? Right there. And this, you want to also put a value of 5, right? You want to be looking at the last 5 bars and what their momentum is telling us, right? So, why this is so important is because if you look at momentum all by itself, just the momentum indicator. It is unbound. The, the scale on the right floats, right? The momentum indicator is a floating scale. It's unbound. And it fluctuates, you know, Based on the input. No, it's not bound from 0 to 100, it, it's floating. Sometimes it's 110, sometimes it's, you know, 76, sometimes it's whatever. It's not a set scale. Very difficult to use the scale on the momentum indicator. And so what Bill Williams did is he took this momentum indicator on bound and he applied an RSI on top of it. And so now the RSI is bound from 0 to 100. Right? So he's basically put the momentum and bound it or binded it, bound it to a scale. And so now you have this this thing here that is trapped between 0 and 100, negative, 0 and 100, right? Uh, basically you're playing. Overbought and oversold using momentum. Right? So momentum is forward looking, and now you're looking to see. How the next candle is behaving. If we put crosshairs on here and look at the cross of the indicator from above to below, put your crosshairs on that. On that cross from above to below and then look up. At the look up at which candlestick created this drop in price. Which candlestick initiated that drop? It was the closing of that green doji up there. The one with the red and the blue dot. Right? So, not the red candle after, but the green candle. The green candle initiated the drop, right? So look at the the cross down here from below to above. If I put the crosshairs right on that. Pross look at which candle. Initiated the move. Right, the clothes. The close of that green candle right here, initiated the rise. Right, so if I go back, let's say over here. And I looked to see which candle initiated this. It was the close of the doji. Right, so this particular indicator, because it's looking at momentum. Is is including the current bar in its calculation, whereas all the other indicators, the other oscillators are excluding the current bar and remember earlier I said we trade without confirmation. Right, we trade the probability. This is a very, very good way of capturing that probable next move, right? The look at the candle that created or initiated the drop, right? Look up. The close of this red candle started this move right there. Right. And so the indicator might help you figure out the stop and start. Of the next leg. Right, so when it's crossing under, it's the beginning of the next leg down. When it's crossing over, it's the beginning of the next leg up. Right? And so you can apply this to maybe uh intraday time frame. And now you might be positioned in your trades for hours, like a swing trader. Right, so be careful, uh, You know, if you're going to use momentum as part of your analysis. Make sure that it's at the same time of day every day, right? So that 2 hour window combined with the momentum that's within it, you know, that volatility that's within it, that's where your money comes from. Right, so study a momentum. Study that 2 hour window, do it from the top down, not bottom up. And you'll be a lot better off, right? Supply and demand is very, very general. Support and resistance is deadly accurate, right? So we're within that zone, right? So supply and demand is just a ballpark. We want to run the bases. Right, so. Enjoy yourselves. This is it. This is all I got. Uh, if you have any more questions or anything like that, you know, reach out to me, reach out and slack, and uh we'll be able to address that kind of stuff. OK. I hope this was useful, right? Some of this may have been a little basic for some of you, some of newer traders, um, may have been blown away, and, but this is it, right? Uh, it's a game of probability with a thick, thick, thick layer of psychology. So if you're using things like fractals and Williams percent R, you're relying on statistics and probabilities way more so than gut feelings. And that should lead the way, you know, for the foreseeable future. All right, so enjoy yourselves, create safe, everyone. OK, I'll see you guys on Thursday, tomorrow. Absolutely, JF, great job. Uh, wow, what a packed hour of info. I'm gonna watch this recording over again for sure. Any questions, place them in slack, of course, make sure you're in the room as much as you can Tuesdays and Thursdays, and uh we'll see you next time. Thanks everyone. All right. Thank you. Bye-bye.


## 17 2025 June - FIFO vs

Hi everyone, this is Mike. Uh, actually I do have microphone, right, so that's good. Uh, we'll get started in just a second. I'll, you're not here to listen to me. You're here to listen to the master of the masterclass, sir. Take it away. Sure, sure, throw big words at me, my goodness. I'm just a regular guy. I'm just a regular guy. I'm just teaching a skill that I picked up over time. So, uh, you know, everybody else should be able to do this. It's a matter of dedication and a little bit of, you know, time. Dedicated to an art. And so some of it has to come from the gut, right? Some of it is outside of just technical analysis, and uh we are dealing with the real world, so, uh, war and things of the likes. And so, in reality, uh, the instrument we choose to trade really has to accommodate our psyche and what we perceive to be. You know, the outside world, uh, impacting our instrument, right? So, what, uh, today's session is really the difference between what the rest of the world does compared to what North America specifically US based traders are forced to do, right? So and there's reasons behind the differences. We're not gonna get into that, but that's That's where we, that's where we stand, right? The rest of the world can do things one way, and US based traders are forced to do a similar thing, a very different way, right? And it's all because of FIFO, this first in, first out. And you have posted out the US new home sales June 2020. I'm just gonna mute this guy for the duration of the hour and uh we have posted out the. Take it from there. OK. So, with this first in first out, you're basically uh having to deal with trading in aggregate, right? So that means every time you click your mouse, it gets added up with the previous clicks, right? So you're basically averaging everything that you do right from click number 2. Right, so you end up with a break even price as soon as you have a second trade on your chart. And so by definition, In order to make any kind of money and not break FIFO, so not close things out of sequence, you basically have to let price cross your break even price, right? So if you're trying to close trades outside of sequence or out of sequence, it will force you to trade the first, it will force you to close the first click first. Right, so for example, if I buy this. I have one contract. These are micros. So I have one contract here, and the minute I want to add a second contract to this, whether I'm already winning or in drawdown, it will average the price with the current contract that I already have. And so the line will move and you still have to cross the line in order to make any kind of money, right? In order to see, right now I'm in draw down to Pips. In this case, it's uh $2.50. Right? And if I want to add a contract, Order filled. You can see how the line just moved. If I add another contract, order filled. Right, the price did not move far enough in order to move the line. Right, so I have to have uh enough flexibility here. There has to be enough volatility to make an impact, right, for you to actually not waste a click. OK. And so, by definition, trading futures will end up being a little bit more expensive, and it all boils down, the success boils down to your money management. Right, and so it will. You'll find that the 36 Pips in the future's world can be somewhat expensive, because you don't have the ability to control risk down to pennies like we do with Forex, right? The less the the smallest you can do is one contract, or in this case, one micro. And so you can't break that up, or you can't go and and buy a half a contract. And so that kind of limits the risk to these chunks, or you can only take chunks of risk. In order to mitigate that, instead of using a 36 pip stop, I'm using an 18 pip stop. And I immediately put an 18 Pip target. And so I basically, I, it's like a. I expect a range. I want to play within this range. And if the market just shoots up and takes me out, I'm happy about it, right? You'll notice 18 Pips is two of our regular boxes. Right, so I'm using. The normal forex boxes, the normal Forex, you know, numbers that we've been working with, I'm just applying them to the futures chart. Right? It is the exact same chart that you see here on the one minute chart, as you would be looking at a CFD. Platform, right? The exact same shape, exact same. Chart. The only difference is the price scale. In this case, they shifted uh about 60 or 70 pips. Right, where 70 pips or so higher than where you are on the CFD chart. OK, but it's the same patterns. If you're breaking a new high, like we did on the euro, we made a new yearly high yesterday, we did the same thing here on the futures charts. OK? So, what we have to accommodate here is the number of clicks in total, right? We're not gonna be using 16. Because we're not gonna be using 36 pips of space, and it all boils down to the cost associated with running 16 contracts or 16 microbes, right? It's just too much. OK. So we want to be be logical about this. We want to mitigate our risks, so we, we want to tighten things up. And in the world of futures, every contract is accounted for. Every single contract is accounted for. It's, it's centralized, right? It's all running from the same exchange, there's a buy for every sell. There's a sell for every bite. Right, so that tells us something, because we can now rely on volume if you're that type of trader, right? You can use volume profiling on here. Uh, I don't rely on it, but some people do, OK? And so, you'll notice I highlighted a range here already when I started trading. I just picked this up with my mind's eye. I just noticed this standard move was replicated everywhere, and so I applied it to the recent low. And I watched Price go through this range the whole time I was sitting here. I placed a couple of trades inside of this, right? So I'm a range trader, and by definition, I'm extremely defensive when it comes to a breakup, especially if it's not in my favor. Right? So a breakout for me today would be a move outside or one range, one standard deviation away from my original entry. And so about halfway to my stop loss. Right? Halfway to my stop loss, I'm allowing myself a couple more clicks. I want to limit the total number of clicks to 4 instead of 16. OK, so I want to limit myself to 4 clicks, and in this case it's 18 pips instead of 36, so 2 boxes. And so you can tell how everything is tighter. In the world of futures, right? I'm taking less risk because each click is worth a little bit more money than I'm normally used to. OK. At the same time, if I could see 3 pips of profit, I don't mind taking that, or let it run, get 9 pips, maybe even 18 pips, right? I'm, I'm using boxes to track my progress, right? So here we're about ready to break out. I'm expecting a move to top. Right, so on the 5 minute scale, we would be expecting. Uh, a breakout and like I just mentioned a few minutes ago. If this is not in our favor, we're extremely defensive here. This is clearly in my favor. I'm trying to be bullish, and so I don't have anything to do. Maybe add. Right, so if I add to my winner, watch what happens to the aggregate price. Order filled. Right, the aggregate price went up. Closer to the current price. Right, so now if I add one more, it's like I'm chasing the price up. I keep adding to my winners. Eventually The move will end, right? Maybe at 9 pips, maybe at 10 or 11 or 7 or 8, somewhere in that neighborhood. And we can pocket all of our profits at once. OK, so we have a breakout into the new box up here. We expect a move and a measured move to the top of the box. It could take the entire length of the box to get there. Right, so we are not pressured into going there right away. If there's a pullback. If there's a pullback, I'm allowed 4 more clicks, and that's it. Right, so, uh, that's if, you know, to pull back. Uh, let's do this. Right, so if there's a pullback and it takes me out, I'm allowed 4 more clicks, right? I can recycle my traits. OK, so that's kind of the idea, right? It's identical to what we do normally in the Forex world, except in the world of futures, we have to deal with the money management side a lot differently. Right, so we're minimizing our exposure by by using fewer clicks in a much tighter arena. 2 boxes instead of 4 boxes of drawdown. So we're not allowing ourselves. To exploit as much drawdown because we can't do it with microscopic money. The smallest we can use is a microcon contract. Right, so I've managed to book a little bit of profit. It's retracing on a red candle. If I can retrace to this white, to this white candle here, this white wick, I'll buy that. Right? And again, I'm giving it 18 pips of space. I'm giving it an 18 pep target, which I don't typically rely on. I tend to take the trades off manually. Right, so let's buy this filled. There's my stop below the previous low. There's a potential, you know, one for one. Risk to reward ratio. If my bias is right, if we are just now retesting this breakout. There's potential for me to add another click. Order filled. All right, so my aggregate price follows along. I now have an average of 2 clicks right there. We can probably show where the clicks are. Uh, I think it's this one. Plot execution. Yeah, there we go. Right, so we can see where the clicks are, and we can see where the average prices. And so on this next red candle, if I add another click somewhere down here. The average price will follow suit. And so I, everything that I do is aggregated. So first in, first out. Basically, uh, is null and void if I close everything. Beyond break even, right? So if I, if I can get into the green, it doesn't matter which order I close the trees. Right, but in drawdown, I can't close trade I cannot close click number 2. Unless click number one has already been closed, right? So, when I'm in drawdown, it forces you to take your worst losers off. It forces you to do that. OK, so Futures is one way of approaching it, uh, the methodology, you know, from, uh, US, you know, resident. Uh, if you want to, you know. Practice maybe in a CFD environment with a demo account. And you can do that also before trying your hands at this, and, you know, in order to do that, you'd probably want to go to a place like FX Blue. Right, go to FXBlue.com. You'll get this window here, go to where it says challenges. You can open accounts for free. Right? Create demo account. It's like a throwaway account, and you'll be able to practice this methodology of averaging in and averaging out. You can see it in action, you know, like the rest of the world sees it. And so this would create a demo account uh without all of the FIFO restrictions. So it's a good way to practice both. Uh, approaches, you know, and then, uh, for those of you that, you know, live in the states and do want to trade CFDs, there still remains a couple of brokers in a gray area, so to speak, right? Traders that, uh, brokers that don't really ask too many questions. They don't care where you come from. Oops, it's I, I misspelled it, sorry. There's an O in there. And so, uh. If you go to this place here, I'm not gonna mention the name. If you go to this place here, you can open an account just like I have, just like anybody else has, right? Just be cautious putting real money in there because it is offshore, and uh they're not asking very many questions. Right? But that's another way of testing the waters to see what are the differences between FIFO and, you know, a non-FIFO account. From a US resident standpoint, it's very difficult for you guys to test that out, right? There's very few brokers outside giving you access to those demo accounts. And so, uh, this guy is still favorable to you. Right, so that's one and that's another way of approaching it. You'll notice they don't have the MT4 or MT5 platform, right? They have uh their own platforms, and there's other reasons for that. OK, so There's alternatives, right? There's different ways of Trading ranges. It doesn't have to be Forex, right? You can do it on ES, you can do it on, uh, you know, micros, you can do it on. Uh, equities, you can do it on commodities. Right, well you have to understand is you're, you're still trading a range until it breaks out. And once it's breaking out, trying to fix the breakout is where the money management steps up to the plate, right? So if I try to buy this right here at support, This is a 20 minute chart. I use 20 minutes because everybody else is using 15. I, I just want to be different from the crowd. 3 bars per hour instead of 4 bars per hour. Uh, I'm looking at support right now, so if I buy this order filled. I'm, oh, I don't have any parameters on here. Order filled. Right, so now I have 2 contracts. Right, so if I buy this, I'm still responsible for the average of the two contracts, and I cannot. Remove one out of sequence, right? I have to close both together. Or I have to close the first one first. Right? So this is the problem with first in, first out, and our methodology requires we scale in. And so when you're trading a scale, uh, when you're trying to scale in in a FIFO environment. You kind of have to have a plan of where you want to take that next trade. And if that next trade is outside of your uh affordable range, you know, if you go 2 boxes too far in this world, it might be way too expensive. Right, so you're limiting your approach, you're limiting your expectations, you're still trying to profit an average bar. Right, so maybe you can bring that down to an average bar, oops, right now. 2.4 points. We're looking at 6, there's 3. Right, so this is within reach, and we're looking at ES, right? So it's not even the euro, we're looking at support. We're looking at 1234 standard deviations. If I'm looking at the grid. So if I refer to the grid as a unit of measure, which it is. The market has moved 3 and a bit grids, 3.5 grids. From high to low Right over here we've moved 2 grids. From high to low. 123 grids on the way up. 2 on the way down. Right, so instead of dragging boxes around, instead of maneuvering objects, I just refer to the objects that are there already. Right, so, uh, extremely adaptable, it's the psychology that supports the thesis. The thesis is just the law of large numbers. Right. As long as you're repeating the same behavior, in this case, in the world of futures, you're using fewer clicks in a smaller amount of space. You're still targeting an average bar. A few minutes ago, I was leaving it at 18 for 18, but, you know, you want to try and take profits as often as possible. Right, and that That uh allows you to keep recycling for that couple of hours, right? It's the same chart, which is beautiful if I go back to uh where's my micro. This is the same chart you're looking at in your CFD contracts. So if I buy this order filled, I just added a third one. I'm adding, I'm adding a 4th 1 and so in order for me to make a profitable trade here. Price has to cross my line that's 1674. And if I can get 3 to 4 pips beyond that. Maybe up to here. I don't have to wait for a breakup. I can just Test the existing high. Right, so you can see the flexibility, you can see how, you know, whether you're trading CFDs or you're trading futures. The range is what you're focusing on, and in reality you're really attempting to be Patient enough to pick off the edges of the box. You know, so you're going to find yourself doing very little work in the middle. And most of your efforts will be at the edges of the box. OK. Uh, let's bring up the chat box, if there's any questions. Uh, no questions. All right, I'll just keep going. So, with, uh, with my browser window go. There it is. And so In here, you can recreate. These uh. Assessments, you know, these challenges that everybody is. Trying to uh get qualified for, you can recreate them in here for free, and see if you can pass those challenges for free. Before you go and pay for one. And that's the idea behind giving you these free resources, right? And so you can see here some of the folks that are trying, you know, they're running some of their own challenges, you can recreate their requirements, you can recreate the environment. And you can try and shoot for the moon, you know, you can try and pass the assessments before spending money. With the demo account, you can try and, you know, think out of the box. This is the only way you can see what the implication of FIFO is. You have to try and close trades out of sequence to see how it impacts the outcome. And in reality, uh, if, if you trade the way we trade by averaging in, It's because you're looking for that next move anyways, right? You're not trying to profit from the current. Target filled. Uh, Oh, it may have been my my ES that got paid. Yeah, yeah, yes, got paid, right? And so. Uh, ideally we're just trying to replicate the same behavior, right? Buying support, selling resistance. And if she can do it with uh oops, wrong, wrong one. If you can do it with patients. So the edges of the box, you have to be patient enough to see it come to you, right? I started down here. At the lower edge of the box down here on that red candle. 20 minutes ago. Uh, more than 20 minutes ago, a while ago. Right, so if you pick the edges of the box, you'll be uh Maybe less productive, but a lot more. Uh, profitable in the end, you know, the clicks will come home. It's a measured move. Right, and already we were suspecting a breakout. We got that wick. Right, we're still on the, on the lookout for that move. Right, I still think it's gonna get there. Right here, so I'll add Or filled, right, so this 5th is adding to a winner. If everything goes to the pooper. I'm one extra trade heavy. Right, so as soon as I see green here, 1 to 2 bars of profit, I'll lock that in. Right. There's so much flexibility because of our expected Standard move, right? We're just looking for a standard move to be replicated over and over and over. And sometimes in the direction of the trend. You're just reusing the same 2 or 3 clicks. Right? And so that would be uh an awesome day, right? That's the typical beautiful day you're looking for. Just recycle for an hour or so and be done with it. That's not what we get, you know. Uh, As a norm, right on the We tend to see. Uh, irregal, like a lot of, uh, it's like. Mashed potatoes. You, you know it's mashed potatoes, but they're never mashed exactly the same. And so we're looking for consistency. We're trying to extract consistency from this, and so this is consistent. It came from the past. And I just have a consistent behavior. When it comes to the three sides of the box. Right, so whether I'm trading with ANO trade on their own platform and CFDs, or whether I'm trading a demo account from FXB Blue, or I'm trading a futures account. This is Liu, I trade with Liu. I have like 10 accounts and so I don't want the SIM, I want number 89. Yeah. Uh, so yeah, you know, you, there's. There's a lot of room to roam, put it that way, and if you still want to trade. Uh You know, within the FIFO rules, within uh the 4 boxes and the 36 pips, then move over to Owanda, right? Trade with the Owanda broker, registered broker in the US, and the one way to circumvent FIFO first in, first out. With Owanda because they offer you to trade in units. is to change each click size and its number of units, right? So if click number one was 99 units, make click number 2 100 units. Make click number 3, 98 units, right? So by changing the number of units, each click. There's no two trades the same, and therefore, each trade is independent and FIFO doesn't apply. Right, so you can circumvent 5FO using Owanda. Because they trade in units. OK, so there's, there's a million ways to trade. There's a few ways to get around FIFO. And all around, you can, you know, you can find that groove that suits you, right? You can trade off support, you can trade off of resistance, you could be a swing trader for a number of grids on the chart. Right, you don't have to be putting yourself in a box, so to speak. You have a lot of flexibility here. The main, main, main criteria is to lock in your profits as fast as possible. Especially with the futures. OK. So it it's, it's really this idea that you're here to not lose. And the byproduct of that is making you money. Right, so if I get taken out here, I'm still making money. And I'm not losing anything, right? So it's a byproduct of not losing. If I bounce off of here. I can maybe tap out, take a bar or two of profit. Right, so it's Managing drawdown. And for us here, it's 2 boxes. 4 clicks and you're trying not to cheat because it's expensive when you do. Right? And it's the same expectations as you would otherwise, you know, standard moves upon standard moves upon standard moves. In the end, you're avoiding the calendar events. You're responsible for event risk no matter what happens. So it could be a tweet, it could be a war that starts over the weekend, which, by the way, was reacted to very, very peculiarly like. The euro only gets 70 pips. You'd think the euro would be trading at 250 by now. At 12:50, I mean, like. The US dropped bombs on Iran and the euro moved 70 pips. It's like the market barely blinked. You'd think in a normal world, the dollar would have been bid. And so I think we're looking at uh the dollar and, you know, the real. The world is pulling back from the dollar as opposed to going in. Uh, you know, full speed ahead like it used to. And so there's a lot of, you know, rebalancing taking place, and speaking of which, you know, value date is tomorrow. And it's also. Uh, end of the week, end of the month, end of the quarter, end of the half year. Uh, 2nd quarter, right, so there's a lot of, a lot of People with reasons. To rebalance things. OK, so, look at where we are right on the edge of the box, as a range trader. The edge of the box is where you would expect a break. Or a continuation, like a continuation of the range, right? We're going to continue to bounce. I expect a break. Right, so I'll buy this filled. And if we retrace to the bottom of the box, Which should be within our 18 pips. It is. Right? So if it's, if it comes back down here, I'll have spread 4 more clicks or 3 more clicks in there. And we're trying to limit our exposure. We're trying to be. Conscientious of where our money is inside of that big plan of ours, right? If you go to an hourly scale. Right, we're still playing the same breakout. If I go to 5 minutes, which is the same as this here. We're still playing the same breakup. We drew this with our minds. I. Right, we just connected a range that we saw. You know, in front of us, it's a standard move. It comes from the market. And we're just expecting more of the same. Right, so our brain is really doing all of the heavy lifting. And we're, we're committing to a standard environment. And it's because we've noticed it's being repeated multiple times. Right, and we're willing to play this environment. Doesn't matter where. It's preferable if you did it at the same time every day, so that you would gain consistency from that window. Right? So We're already 3 peps up, 4 pips, but if I add to my winner. What if I add to my winner? Right, so it's almost like we're expecting this, uh. Just like we were earlier. OK, so in theory, you're controlling what comes, um. You're controlling what happens to you next, based on how you react right now. So, by not over clicking, by not overspending, by, by not, you know, going too far beyond your skis. You can mitig the damage if something is, you know, not working out. Its first in, first out. Removes your ability to fix. Right? This is why in my world I have 4 boxes and 16 clicks. Right. The 1st 4 clicks are all average to each other. That's box number 1. The next 4 clicks belong to box number 2. And now I'm averaging 2 boxes to each other. So the whole thing is a game of averaging. And here, the averaging is done for you. And so here you have no choice but to be break even or better. There's no way for you to make 3 pips. Before breaking even. Right, so up here you can remove 1 or 2 contracts. But you, if you try to to do it before breaking even, you would be forced to close your worst loser first. OK, so first in, first out, and then there's also Uh, No. A very limited choice of brokers from a Forex standpoint, I think you have 5 or 6 forex.com all around uh. Uh, I think you have Is it interactive broker, so yeah, you, you're you're limited as far as resources, right? But it's still, it's still doable. Iron Beam is a good. Futures broker. I worked with them before. There's a few, few alternatives, right? Ale trade, like I said, um. Don't put a lot of Good money there, you know, don't give them $50,000. Wonder where it went missing. If anything, put small cash, grow small amounts and withdraw. Every month, you know, take your profits out as often as possible. And uh you know, Survive as long as you can. OK, so the the alternatives are Uh, Don't try to average it, you know. Uh, try to be exact, you know, try to be a little bit more patient. With your entries, maybe use fewer clicks, but in the end, uh, it's It's a game of averaging. The price is an average. It's up, it's down, it's somewhere in the middle, right? So you're behaving in such a way to capture and extract from an average. So figure out what the average move is. And then use it in the future. Right use the average move in the future. And it doesn't matter whether you have FIFO to deal with or not, the psychology of the process, you know, you stepping through the process. is because of psychology. I don't care what anybody says, and if you're missing this psychology piece. You know, if you're solely relying on technical analysis or solely relying on indicators, or if you're trying to ignore your gut. You're asking for trouble. Everybody is a marksman. Everybody, you know, for tens of thousands of years, we've been Hitting the mark. That's how we survive, that's how we eat. This is no different. And you just have to figure out a way in your mind to get in front of that break even. So one way to do that is by spending 1 or 2 clicks and moving break even. If I had a click now, as I'm already winning, I'm adding to my risks filled. And it's moving closer to the current price. Right, so that's something you would want to do when you're far away in profits, not one or two ticks. Right? And likewise, when things are in drawdown, you don't want to be adding right away. You want to wait until it is at the edge of the box. Oops. You want to wait until it is at the edge of the box down here before you. Throw in more money, right? You want to try and get the biggest bang for your buck on that moving average. OK, so you're controlling that moving average, you're controlling. The outcome of FIFO. So if you're beyond breaking even, like we are here, you can close all three contracts regardless of the sequence. It's when things are backwards, the sequence is critical. And so you're limiting that sequence to maybe 4 clicks. And then this may not even have to be 18 pips. OK, so I'm still using the. I was using my palm. That's better. That's more like it. Or filled. That's way more like it. 18. 18 18. OK, so Uh, if, if you're trading CFDs. Uh, if you're living in America, see if these is Out of reach for you, so you're gonna find yourself trading futures, you might want to be trading, you know. Uh, ES or NQ or gold or whatever, it's the same idea, right? You're buying support, you're selling resistance, you're doing it inside of a standard amount of space. And you're limiting yourself to a standard amount of contracts, right? So you're basically behaving like a machine. You're trying to remove as much of the variability. As possible. Right, and I see here. How many boxes is this? 34, and this was 4 boxes. OK, so we're not looking for anything outside of what we normally would do. It's just how once you find this standard move, How you go about making your money with it is where the adjustments take place. You have to limit the number of clicks, you have to adjust your expectations. You can still be making one bar of profit. Right, 3 pips. You can take that 3 pips. Oh, now it's down to 2. OK, so if I get 3. Or 4 or 5. You wanna close the whole position and start over again. Right, so you're not just removing one to add one, you're flattening the whole thing to rebuild it. Yeah. The best thing for us is to be patient and hit the mark. And so, if it pulls back to the edge of the box, cause we understand this to be a standard move, right? So a pull back to the edge of the box might just be the spring that's required. To give us the whole box, right? So we're willing to buy this little drop here, right, we're willing to buy it back to support. So same idea, we're spreading the money that we have, except here we're using less of it, because each time you click your mouse, it has a bigger impact. right, so there's 4 ticks or 4 pips. I'll take that. Order filled. Right, so we're up. Almost $200. If I get a red candle here, I'll reset the trade, right? I'll recycle. Click number one. And begin, you know, putting in 4 more clicks. I want to see a red red candle for a cheap entry, wherever I am right there. Order filled. So this now is that grid that I'm in right now, that's box number one. And you'll notice if it has to go down here, that becomes box number 2. On the flip side, Box number 1, and the target is in box number 2. Right, so here I am, a little bit of drawdown, right, minus 2 pips. Order filled. Click number 2, my 2 has been average to -1. And so I'm, I'm in control of an average price, no matter what I do. Right, if you, if you don't want to be doing this, then go to Angle Trade or go to Owanda. Right, so there's alternatives for you guys. It's not just, you know, one size fits all. You got Take your poison. Some of you guys in the states are really favoring futures by, you know, you have every right to do so. It is the way to go, you know, it is a centralized market. It has a ton of advantages. But for me, uh, I prefer Forex still because I can. have better control. So I just added a 3rd contract. My average drawdown is 2 pips. Right. My stop remains exactly where it was, so I don't have staggered stops. My target remained exactly where it was, so I don't have staggered targets. And so when you're trading in aggregates, you're just adding more to the pot, or you're just This is why you have to limit how much more you're going to add. It gets really, really easy to go out of control with those 16 clicks. So, oh, Honda is the closest thing to trading CFDs. And you all you have to do is adjust your size by one unit, so basically one cent. Yeah, each time you click your mouse, and you'll be able to Legally, without without breaking any rules, circumvent F5O. It's really important to learn to operate within the regulations because at some point you go beyond breaking even and you start making money. And now that money has to come home somehow, right? So if you're trading offshore, you have to bring that money back to the US and that's when the IRS will say, where did that money come from? And uh as soon as you spill the beans, they'll close the door, right, so. Just Learn to operate within the rules. It's OK to test the waters, you know, it's OK to see what other people do. But if you're trading in the US, trade within the US rules. So do things legally. Rwanda is one way to approach that. Otherwise they would have been shut down a long time ago. I used to deal with Rwanda when I lived in Ontario back in the early 2000s. And then when I moved to Alberta, uh 2006, I submitted for a change of address with the broker, you know, forward my mail to this new address. And as soon as they realized I was moving to Alberta. Uh, they closed the account and sent me my deposit. Uh, in Canada, all 10 provinces have regulations and dependence of each other, and in Alberta, You have to be a uh What's it called? accredited investor. In order to trade Forex, specifically Forex. And so, that one little, you know, uh, item in the rules uh forced Owanda to kick me out. Because I was clearly not an accredited investor at the time. And so ever since then, uh, I've been using offshore brokers. And so when you bring money home, an offshore broker is is legal. There's nothing illegal about it. Uh, but most of them don't accept US residents because of this FIFO stuff. Right, the US. Government is limiting your access to CFDs. But it's not limiting your access to euros. You can still trade euro contracts, so you can still trade. The world. It's just a different approach. So it's not impossible, right? We're doing it here. We've done it here this morning. I don't, you'll see I have indicators on here. Uh, I don't really use them for much. I like to see if I'm above 50 or below 50 on the RSI. And if I'm just coming out of overbought or coming out of oversold, I don't really care if I'm going into it, I care more when I'm coming out of it. Right, so if we're, let's say for example, uh, right here, we're coming out. Of the overbought It's, uh, that's a clue, right? But the real signal to sell is when you go below 50, right? If you don't go below 50, uh, we might be going back up again. And so there's a relationship between overbought and oversold and where you are relative to 50. All right, so we're in drawdown with 3 contracts and 1 pit. So let's take a 4th contract. Order filled. I'm just adding to show you, uh, if things go backwards, you know. We do have an ejection seat. It's half as much as what we normally would use. So right away, I'm not gonna have a 36 pip stop, you know, if things really go backwards, I'm only gonna lose 18 pips, and I'm More or less committing to using a lot fewer clicks. And so when the poop really hits the fan, it's nowhere near as bad as losing 4% of your account. But you're doing that on purpose. Because you don't have the ability to fix mistakes like I do, right? I have 16 clicks to try and try and try and try and try again. Eventually, I find the bounce I'm looking for, and most of the time, all of my trades get paid. Here, I just cannot afford looking and looking and looking and looking to find what I'm looking for. I have to be a little bit more dedicated to my levels. And so patience, discipline, all that good stuff. Right, so me personally, when I trade futures, it's more like going. For the weekend at, you know, at the casino, it's, I, I trade futures. Uh, as a, as a hobby, not as a way of earning a living. I, I practice with futures. I, I play with futures. This is why I have so many of these. Throw away accounts. I, I do have, I do have a couple of funded accounts. I do have a bunch of throwaway accounts. I do have accounts that recycle every month, you know, that reset every month. Um. I use futures to test the waters, you know, I like to see things. The way you see things. But I'm not forced to trade that way. A lot of times I'll trade NQ or MNQ. In the evenings. So it's after hours. It's very rare that I'll trade futures while I'm trading Forex at the same time. So control, discipline, tighter ranges, smaller or same similar expectations, 3 to 4 pips. And then flatten everything and do it again, do it again, I just keep doing the same thing. Dillan is asking what indicators I'm using. It's the same ones on all the charts. It's the ATR and RSI default settings on all the charts. Sometimes I'll switch the RSI to a stochastic. But it's still just an oscillator, and I am still just a range trader. Right, and so. Uh, I'm typically not looking for confirmation on anything. I'm usually preemptive. I'm usually ahead, no, we're trading for the next bounce, not the current one. And so we're, we tend to be early. And we wait a lot. That's why this 50%. Is kind of what I'm waiting for, you know, are we holding 50 or we gonna break through 50? Should I bother trying to add to this, or should I wait and add lower? Right, the moving averages, uh, visually, I see. which way they're standing, like uh like a rainbow, like a, a ribbon. But I don't really care for the crosses. The crosses don't mean anything to me. I'm just, I'm logically more looking at price and what price is doing relative to what it did in the past, like right here, right now, price is breaking out. The moving average will eventually support what I'm thinking. They tend to be way, way late. Right, so eventually the green line will be above the yellow, and both of them will be above the orange. The box is telling me this ahead of time. So we're not trying to forecast 4 or 5 boxes into the future. We're just trying to get across the current. Standard move, right? So think of this as a Bollinger band, right, we're trying to get to the top of the band. This would be the middle of the Bollinger, oops, I didn't want to do that, and this would be the bottom of the Bollinger. All right, so if you had a Bollinger band. Middle, bottom. And top. And we're just trying to get from the bottom through the middle. To the top. If it doesn't go and it comes back, we have the willingness, the ability. And in some cases, even the money. To recycle or add to our trades. Right, it's this expectation. And then at the same time, we have a lower limit, you know, where we must. Yeah. Where we must Uh, do something, right? If we make a lower low, we already know we want nothing to do with this. Um, let's see. I think we're doing all right so far. So 1 pip on 4 contracts. 375. A little bit more. And, you know, I could probably close that right now. Order filled. Finished today with 200 bucks, 1 hour of work, I'll take it. No complaints trading micros. Right. So that's the kind of stuff, right? As long as you understand what the average is, and you can position yourself within this average. You're looking to extract, oh, here's the bar I was looking for. We're looking to extract average moves within an average standard deviation. And so if you're patient enough to pick up. Off of support or off of resistance, you tend to get what you're looking for. Regardless whether it's first in, first out, or otherwise, right? So I gave you guys some alternatives. You don't have to trade futures, you know, or you don't have to trade CFDs, uh. Experiment and see where, you know, whatever suits you best. Your best bet as a US citizen is either futures like we did here or Rwanda, right? So that would be the two avenues I would. Go down first. Right. Enjoy yourselves, folks, and uh we'll be in touch. All right. Thank you everyone. Great job. Any questions, by all means, we're always available on Slack, uh, you know, pretty much during the regular trading hours and uh be safe out there and thank you again JF. Have a great day. Thanks, thanks a lot. Bye bye.


## 18 2025 July Mastering Swing Trading How to Use Price and Time Cycles for Consistent Profits aac

Uh, one thing I, one thing I love about moderating, um, sessions is, uh, I don't wait like 10 minutes for people to come in and all that. We just get right going. We're traitors, and, uh, you didn't come here to hear me talk. You came here to JF and at minimum, we're going to learn how to spell the words Brownian and Camarillo. Yeah, take it away. Awesome, yes, so, uh, it is all about mastering swing trading, which is something we're all trying to do. Uh, you know, I happen to master doing the 3 pips, 33 pips on the way to mastering swing trading. It's, uh, one builds into the other, you know, you have to kind of cross 3 pips in order to make 45, 1012. And so, uh, let me bring this slide here, Brownian motion. I'm just gonna touch on that very quickly before I move over to a PDF file that I want to go through, uh, as a group. And so, on this particular slide, uh, referred to as Brownian motion, some of you may be familiar. We're focusing most of our efforts as short-term scalpers right around here. Right? We make our 3 pips. It's, it's the easiest target to achieve, right? You have to cross 3 before you get to 30. Right? So, uh, in order for us to be uh successful, we're targeting a very, very, very high probability. First and foremost, right? We're not just clicking the mouse willy-nilly. There has to be support or resistance for us to take that trait. Right? So imagine taking that trade, and now letting it run further than just 3 pips, right? So if you're on the right side, maybe you're trading on the bullish side, and instead of just aiming for 3 pips as a scalp, like most of us are training to do. What if you see the potential and you remove the target, right? So now you have an open-ended trade. And maybe minutes, you know, maybe hours later, that trade is still moving favorably, right? So you're moving further and further away from the highest probability of success. Right? So, at some point, that trade will stop working and, you know, you'll want to pocket your profits, right? But the repeatability of this to be able to repeat this over and over and over and over. It is not the same as the ability to repeat a three bit trait over and over and over, right? So you can see where you're giving up a little bit of of uh Uh, high probability of success in exchange for bigger gains, right? So you're trying to, you're trying to Find your groove, you know, based on the facts that you have in front of you, because no two swing traits will be the same. Right. So this is kind of ideal to give you an idea of why we're focusing our efforts as scalpers on a small, achievable, repeatable, consistent goal, right? 3 pips, 3 pips, 3 pips, 3 pips is the top of this bell curve. It keeps us focused here. Right? And the longer we stay in these trades, the more likely we're raw. Right? Likewise, if you're attempting to swing trade, every trade will start at 0. Actually, it's, they start negative because of spread, and then they have to turn positive and hopefully in your favor, right? Either bullish or bearish. But the longer you stay in those traits. The more you deviate, uh, the more you go off of the highest probability of success, right? So keep that in mind. Now, now that we've covered this Brownian motion, now that you understand where we fit in this, as scalpers, we're trying to operate here. As swing traders, you're gonna be somewhere in the middle. Right? And as investors, you're usually way off, you know, in the distance. You have bigger plans, you have a whole different reason for being here. Right, so, uh, going from this slide, I want to then take us over to this PDF file. Right, so this is something that I was uh showing prevented uh via the APA refund. And we're still showing this at the APR refund, you know, today they're still presenting it. And so basically how to make swing trading work for you. And working for you is not necessarily working for me, right? So this is where again, psychology takes a foothold and you have to, you know, Incorporate your Aptitudes into this way of trading, right? It's not a one size fits all, set it, forget it, you know, it's not. It it's, it is mechanical, but not to the nth degree, right? There's still room there for flexibility. OK, so basically, if you start with the question, right, swing trading. Uh, how long will you be in the street? And how much money can you make? And so that would be ideal if you knew the answers to these two questions, you'll have no problem. But then where do you find the answers, right? Most people that start to trade, they don't have a clue what swing trading is, as opposed to the other strategies. It's just one of many. And they may even go to Google or YouTube to find these answers, right? So if you ask Google what is a swing trade. Right? Google doesn't know that. The, the details of what it is you're looking at, right? So, it will tell you more than a session, more than a week, it's less than 2 months, so it will tell you anything. Right? It doesn't have a clue as to what it is you're looking at. You, it's almost impossible to give it enough details, right? You can't ask AI. Because it's still missing information, right? It's always on the information gathering mission, the same way we are. Right? So, in order to find the right answer, you and I have already been doing this. We've already been looking at it, uh, Through the lens of a swing trader, except we've been doing it on under a microscope. Right, and I'll show you that here, right? So the, the, the real answer, the paradigm shift. is to seek the answer from the chart, right? All along is an average trade and all along. Or how much Can it pay me? And understanding where you fit in the Bigger scheme of things, you can get details that most people ignore, you know, in particular, the time cycle. Right, so, and I've already touched on that, you know, uh, through your courses so far, and you're already figuring out the boxes, right? You've been trained to calculate your own box for whatever market you're looking at for your two-hour window in particular. Well, imagine if you just figured out the average swings. Anytime, without a 2 hour window, right? So you're just showing up to the computer, you measure the swings on your left, and you average. A handful of them. Right, so right away. You can have an average idea of what the market is potentially capable of. Right, so on the daily chart, if you were to average swings. An average swing is about 14 days on the daily chart. Right? And then you and I are working on the one minute chart. And we already understand 14 minutes. It is a good average to get to the top of the box from the bottom of the box. In reality, It happens sometimes even faster than that. And that is a clue to us that there's incoming volatility. And that's when we move the box where the new break is, and we follow into the new box. So we are stacking boxes as we make a new high or making new lows, so on and so forth, right? So you're already partially swing trading, except you're, you've been doing it targeting only 3 pips, and you're hoping to do it within 14 minutes. Right, so you're the way we trade as scalpers and our boxes. It's, it's a uh. It's like a diluted swing trade. OK, so now moving a little bit forward from here, if we were to use price and time cycles, right, so both combined. To answer the question. Instead of going to Google. Then you can kind of anticipate. A wage, right? Money for time, time for money. And so instead of opening a trade, and then hoping for the best. You give it a window of time to operate within. So if it, you know, if it happens to work within that window. It works. If it breaks out of the window without giving you what you're looking for, it's a failed trip. Right, so the way we think about the failure. Has to incorporate time. Right, so that's becoming an opportunity cost. And it allows you to take your money and go look somewhere else, instead of waiting for something that is never coming. OK, so first we're gonna look at price cycles. We've already done that, right? I've already taught you how to do this, right? We, uh, you guys have been trained to do this on a five-minute chart. Right, measuring a dozen swings or so. Maybe up to 20. You don't want to, and you've been doing it for maybe 20 days and you've been averaging 20 days of data. Right, so imagine if you. weren't focusing on only the Euro USD for that two hour window, but instead, you wanted to trade a different instrument every day. Well, you could walk up to your computer. You can measure the swings, distance between, you know, pivot low and pivot high or swing low swing high. You could average the last dozen or so cycles. To get an average price cycle. Right? And then to simplify the target. Aim for 1/3. Of the cycle. Right? So instead of asking for more, That the market is able to give. Which probably won't give you any more than what it's capable of. Why not ask for less? Right, so why not ask for only 1/3? Of what the potential is. And if you're Somewhere near the right location for that bounce. Capturing that 1/3 of the potential. Is a very high probability. OK, so now it doesn't really matter what time frame you're on, right? Because we looked at that over here. Right? The swing trader is focusing on any time frame. Any time frame, as long as it's the blue line. Right, the intermediate trend. On any time frame. OK, so you're focusing on the blue. While already you've been trained to focus on the red, or you've been trading the red. The reason why we took 20 days of data, and then you divided that 20 days by 3 and you added 1. is to create or is to figure out the swings within the swings. And so you remember when you created your 95 box? You had to figure out the bell curve. And uh the top of the bell curve was 27 pips, and we broke that down into 9 pip boxes. 9 pip boxes is the red line. The average blue line is what you had calculated on your 5 minute chart. All right, so going back here. The time frame doesn't really matter. Right, it's what you aim to capture. From The potential. Right, so the potential is there aim to take 1/3 of it, and the probability of success is extremely high. Well, everybody else is looking for hundreds of pips. In exchange for, you know, 50 or 100. You know, give me 200 because I'm willing to lose 100. In reality, you're not willing to lose shit. And so aim lower, right? Target. The easier amount and adjust your size and your risk appropriately. You can create a 2 to 1 risk to reward ratio. Right? Working backwards from the target. And the target is a potential that's already there. It's not some imaginary number that you're hoping for. OK, so that's the price cycle, that tells you what your wage might be. Based on the last 20 swings or so. Right, so the next, the upcoming swing has a potential of delivering so much. And you're gonna try and take only 1/3 of that, right? And so now you want to know how long you're gonna get paid, right? When do you get paid? every hour, every 2 days? Like how often are these cycles? Right, so then you have to look at time cycles, which then you've already done. You've done this on a 5 minute chart in order to be a 35 scalier. Right, so imagine if you figured out the time cycle on a 15 minute chart. Or an hourly chart or a daily chart. It will tell you On average, How long before you get paid. And if it takes longer than that, Take your money and go somewhere else, right? Don't waste time waiting for things. Right. Opportunity cost is rising. And so in order to measure the time cycle, we've already, you know, we're well aware of this as a group, I think we've all done this in order to figure out our boxes. Right, you measure Uh, between the pivot high and the pivot low in order to create a time cycle. If you do 12 or so, in this case it says 10, and if you do a dozen or so time cycles to get an average time cycle, And the trade duration is the time cycle, right, so on our one minute chart, It's usually 15 minutes or less. To go across the box. Right? And because our box is one hour long. That comes from the 5 minute chart. We should be able to bounce 3 to 4 times. In in a normal, you know, boring environment. If there's volatility, we may break out of the box. Well within the 15 minutes, right? So instead of bouncing and just going sideways for a whole hour. Maybe we're breaking through the boxes like we did yesterday. In 15 minutes or less. Right? So if you kind of replicate this on the daily chart, an average time cycle on the daily chart is about 15 days. How many of you out there are trading the daily chart and holding onto your traits for 2 weeks? Very few, right? See how much potential you're giving up. Right, so, on the other side, we trading on the one minute chart. For 2 hours. We have bounces. Every 15 minutes or so, or at least it's expected. If we don't, something is ongoing, right? There's volatility, there's a reason why we're not balancing. OK. And so, putting all of that together, Right? You want to use the average time cycle. You want to use the average price cycle to qualify a swim tree. Is it worth your while? How long will this take trade? How much can you make? 18 pips in 15 days or 3 pips in 15 minutes. Does that ring a bell to anybody? Right? None of this is new. We've just been doing it under a microscope. And now you're seeing how you can use it under a telescope instead. Right, so the ability for us to figure out what the market is capable of. Uh, it's not just a set and forget it. Right, you have to have an aptitude for that particular time frame, right? Maybe the one minute chart is just way too fast for you. There's nothing wrong with that. Don't feel bad for being, you know, outpaced by the chart. Go up to a 5 minute or 15 minutes. Repeat these steps. Maybe even, you know, if you repeat these steps 20 days in a row, and you average those 20 days to each other, you can create a box for whatever time frame you're looking at. Right. And now you're trading the potential that this box. contains. It doesn't have to be 9 pips in 15 minutes, or, you know, 18 5s and 15 days, right? It can be anything in between. And depending on what instrument you're creating, this could be very, very, very different. Right, so in reality, you have a lot more. Control over the outcome of your trades from an engineering standpoint, right? From creating or extracting what it is you're looking for from the market, right? I'm sure you've heard me say that before. Right, you, you can extract what you need from the market. It's just a river of opportunities. We show up with a bucket, we fill the bucket, and we walk away. And there's guys that are over trading, trying to overfill the bucket. What's the point of that? Right? So, if you understand the size of your bucket, so you, you figure out, you know, how long will it take to fill this, you can seek the trades. That will fit the requirements. Right, you can turn the table around. Instead of hoping for the best, you can create the best outcome. OK, so this is really the gist of it, right? It took 21 minutes to go through this file, but it, it really is swing trading in a nutshell, and because we're trading from this boxes, or we're we're already trading with a box. What if you take that trait? With your box and you see the potential. Right, right here, we're breaking out of the box. It took less than 15 minutes. Right, it took 13 minutes. We're breaking out of the box. And now the potential exists that we do one box, and if we have the trend right, What if we do 2 boxes, 3 boxes, 4 boxes, 5678, you don't have to risk more. Then one box. Right, so now you can risk one box or less if you want to. And you can open this up to boxes into the future. Right, I like Target 4. Into the future. Because I usually I don't usually bother moving my stop loss. So I usually leave 4 boxes of risk. In order to make 4 boxes of profit, and that becomes a 1 to 1 risk to reward ratio. Like this, I can walk away from, set and forget. And because it uses the box that came from the market. I just happened to stack them. Hopefully, you know, if the market was to just fall right now. Hopefully we'd get here in less than an hour. Right, but that's usually not the case, right? So we have to accommodate and we're willing to adjust. Right, wherever the break will happen. We're measuring in real time. And so from a protection side of things, so, if you're the type of person that likes to have a trailing stop. Trail using the boxes. Allow for 1 to 2 boxes between the current price. And the stop loss. So 1 to 2 boxes, right, the stop loss would be about 18 ips away. And if the market moves up 2 boxes, then the market, the price would be at break even. Right, so there's an opportunity. To be uh. Floating a little bit of drawdown along the way without giving back everything. Right, you, you want to be able to use boxes as a measuring device. Both looking forward, you know, into the future. You're looking at levels that are potentially You know, going to be called for. So we're looking left, right, this level here. This level here may go all the way back further. Right and all because it's all because we started measuring from up there. OK, so the swing trading. In in the way I look at things is through standard deviations. And instead of capturing the potential of one standard deviation. I'm giving it multiple standard deviations. To pay me. Right, but I've come to realize the pay is a lot less. Right, so I make more money targeting 3 pips, 35s, 3 pips. Then I do Rising that 1% on that one swim. It's because of what happens inside the box, right? Sometimes here we have multiple trades within the box. Right, so the potential average yield PAY. Is higher. And it's a, it's a balance, right, you have to find. What suits your expectation? What makes you Happy content, you know. If I take another straight right here. And I choose to move this target. Move the target 4 boxes away. Nothing says I can't, you know, if you want to move the boxes 8, you know, move the target 8 boxes away. You can, you know, 90 pips right there, that'd be 10 boxes. But the probability of that working is lower. Then if you just try to trade within an ADR. Right, which is the idea behind that slide I showed you, right, 1/3 of the price cycle. And so by targeting less. Then Most people think. You end up consistently. Winning, right, you win the same amount over and over and over and over and over and over. The sizes of, you know, your trades. I still I don't normally deviate that far off the 0.25%. It's the number of clicks that I tend to cheat with. Right, so just be caut. Conscious, just be aware of the number of clicks that you're using for your swing trades, especially if you're combining swings and 3 pips in the same account. Because it will end up, uh, Borrowing from Peter to pay Paul, right? You don't want to be taking away from your 16 clicks. In order to have swing trades. Uh, if you're going to be blending. The two strategies, you know, in, in the same account at the same time, just be aware where your money is. Any questions? No. So yeah, this particular PDF file, uh, this is from the APR refund. And The price cycle, you know, this is kind of. It, it's not really a ha ha moment, but the 1/3 of the average price cycle. Really settled me down. Uh, I, my expectations were way off. Once I started shooting for this, things kind of change. Right, you, if you're specifically just doing swing trading and following this methodology here, 1/3 of the average price. You will come out ahead in the long run. Uh, just a second. I have to close my window. And so, uh, in In most instances, uh, Prior to doing this, I was starting. Based on what I was risking. This changed things, right? This makes me. Target what the potential is. Oh, some news just came out. Well it's oil inventories, right, and and by the same token. I used to sit on trades that would just not pay out or pay a portion. And then turn around and turn negative. Right? This doesn't allow that anymore. This idea of making the 3 pips in 15 minutes or less, we know this by going into box number 2. Right? If you're going into box number 2, things are clearly going backwards, right? They're not going in your favor. If you're doing this as a swing trader, and you're breaking up that trade into multiple pieces, Going into box number 2 is definitely where you would want to put the other piece, right? You don't allow boxes 3 and 4 when you're a swing trader. you're trying to be more meticulous with your entry. And you don't have so much discretion when it comes to fixing a bad tree. And so you can, however, incorporate fixing a battery. You know, you can figure out Plan B with your swing trade, where would you potentially add to create an average? Right? And so that doesn't mean you've given up on your bias. It just may extend how long it takes for your swing trades, right? So this averaging in and averaging out. His ideal. Uh, the problem is fivefold, right, first in, first out. And so for most swing traders, they'll only take one click. They won't add or remove from their swing trades. And so this price and time cycle allows you to be a little bit more accurate with your one click. And what its potential is, right? So, uh, swing trading, it really is just focusing. Let's go back here for a sec. Uh, it's it's focusing on the dominant trend. Uh, uh, the independent trend allows you to realize where you may have a pullback. Right. And then if you're going to have a pullback or a counter trend move, you're gonna be fading. And so, you know, the terminology is something you may want to be aware of, but in most cases, Swing traders are trend traders. Right, and uh this is where we deviate, right? We don't really care for the trend. We trade whatever uh I We we trade the The minutia that makes the trend, right? So the pullbacks, the, the, uh, The retests and this kind of stuff, right? So if you want to, I'll post this in the Slack group, you guys can download it for yourselves, you can, you know, keep it on your computer. Keep the recipe handy. And it really is not more complicated than 10 time cycles to get an average. And 12 price cycles to get an average. Right, so you could do this with pen and paper every morning when you sit down, just by looking to the left, right? And you can do this on any time frame. It could be a 15 minute chart. And the guy that created this document, or one of them anyways, trades the pound on the 15 minute chart, and he's been doing it for years. He trades price and time cycles. He's the most patient trader I've ever come across. Uh, he's also the guy that put up a video on YouTube about Price and pickles, right, the API refund. His name is Nate Allred. Anyways, uh, if you go check out YouTube channel, the API refund, and you type in or search for price and time cycle, there's a video there from Nate Allred. And uh you you'll be, you'd be wise to go and watch it. It puts more details to this slide here. Mhm So yeah, yeah, yeah. So Dylan is asking if he wants to figure out the 4 hour box, would he trade it with the 1 hour or the 5 minute chart. Uh, you can, that would be ideal, right? But just don't trade with the bigger candle, right? Because what you're figuring out is the potential inside that box. And in order to extract more of that potential, you want to be granular. Right, so anything inside that box? It's still, you know, bouncing, it's still going from bottom to top or top to bottom. And you can play that with the intermediate time frame. All right, so if you're going to trade inside the 4 hour box with, for example, a 15 minute chart. You want to try to swing trade your way through the box? Try to capture 1/3. Of what that box is. And you want to do it off the edges, you know, as a bounce. Right, so the 1/3 APC. Uh, on our 1 minute chart is 3 pips at the right time of day. So it just coincidentally. Right here. 1 minute chart, 3 pips. It so happens to be 3 pips at 10 o'clock Eastern. So, but yeah, this is the recipe to stay. Within the market's ability to deliver. Right, so why ask Mr. Market for something it can't do, or that we don't know if it can do. Right? Why not turn that around and ask for stuff that you know. The market is capable of. And to that effect, you actually ask for less, so you're getting it more often than not. Right, so if the market is able and capable of dishing out 10 pips every hour. And you show up and you ask for 4 pips. It's very difficult for the market not to give it to you. So by asking less and doing so, preferably at the right time. The probability of success goes up tremendously, right? So, going back to this first slide over here, where did that go now? Oh, I know. This one. Right, so we're moving away from over here. And based on the time cycles, we're going to be somewhere. Along this axis here. Right. Again, depending on the chart you're operating on, depending on where you're calculating your swings. You're trying to stay away from the extremes. Uh, you, you want to be somewhere. Closer to the, the highest probability. So it's using a little bit of logic and figuring out the facts for what they are. Every day, you know, so if today's swings are bigger than average, so be it. If today's swings are smaller than average, so be it. When you're a swing trader, Consistency kind of goes out the window. Right, I wanted to aim for consistency and so swing trading is not where my focus went. Uh, you can create consistent swing traits. You can, right, but it's, it's uh. Added challenge for, for what reason? And so opportunity is kind of where my head is at. If I see one and I have money sitting there doing nothing, I'll take the opportunity. Uh, if I'm already tapped out because of the 16 clicks, I'm usually not gonna be taking more risk with swing trades in that same account. And that takes me to, you know, breaking up the accounts into smaller accounts, keeping things independent of each other. Same thing with the journal. Right, I wanna have my journal entries, uh. Keeping track of, of the strategy that I'm working. And so if I start blending strategies in the same account. Obfuscates things that makes things more. Uh, complicated to. You know, keep straight. Long story short, right, swing trading is what most people try to do. But they're starting with the wrong question. And so if you understand what the market is capable of, it really Puts things at ease from there on. It's easier to figure out. Where things went wrong. So I have 2 at the 2 at the top of this box right here. I have 2 at the top of this box right here. I'm gonna take these and move them down here. 1836 lips. Oops, oh, that's new. Uh, I've never used this before. Uh, they're there. Alright, so now I have my 4 clicks. I'm just gonna leave everything as is. Right, so I'm risking. 36. I'm risking 36 to make 36. 363636. So it's a 1 to 1 risk to reward ratio. And as things progress, if they progress in my favor. I can move the stop losses, I can lock in some of the profits, and, you know, preferably if I can find my way down here, I can even add maybe 2 more clicks. Right, add to my winners. OK, so you're in control because you've broken up. That trade into multiple pieces. So I've, I've just now spent 1%. A typical swing trick. But I've broken it into 4 clicks. It's occupying 9 pips of space on my chart. Right, so I'm, I'm occupying a range. The average is right there in the middle. And uh if I can get, you know. Less drawdown than What I'm used to, things go, things are going favorably right away, right? I'm used to 36 ips of drawdown, very little anxiety, right, but as a swing trader, You don't want any kind of drawdown. As a swing trader, you want it to go your way right away. Uh So, uh, as a swing trader, you usually don't have a plan B. Your plan B is the exit. So maybe the exit is 18 pips, right? If you want to make it a 2 to 1 swing trade. Bring it down to 18 5s. And Target 36. There's a 2 to 1. There's a 2 to 1 sling trade. So, as far as the swing trading itself, right, we have to go back to to the whiteboard. We have to remember where we fit on here. Right, we're looking for. The blue line. And every day when you do your top-down analysis, the very first chart you're looking at is the green, and you're looking at the daily or even higher. And you're you're staring at the very last scandal, and you're comparing it with the one before. And you're trying to see, is it still making higher highs, it's it's still making higher lows? At some point, it fails to make higher highs and higher lows. It starts to make lower lows, lower highs. Right, at some point, the green line. is no longer doing what it's supposed to do. The blue line will have been showing you this already. And the red line will already be knee deep in that behavior. Right, so because we are. Hyperfocus on the red. We tend to not see the forest for the trees, right? We, we tend to forget where we are in the blue moon. When we do our top-down analysis, that blue line is the hourly chart. It's the intermediate time frame we're looking for. So when we do our top down and we highlight the ceiling and the floor, we're highlighting the ceiling, we're highlighting the floor, we're trading the red environment. Between the ceiling and the floor on the hourly return. And we're expecting one to give way in order to fulfill the ADR. Right, so swing trading, like it says here, you can take advantage of any time frame. And the entry Can conceivably come from the one minute chart. And just because you don't have a target, it can conceivably turn into the green line here. It can turn into a daily candle. Right, so a one minute tree can turn into a daily candle. It's all up to you and what you, you know, see as potential. So the ability to hold. A trade open It is for some people extremely difficult, me included. I'm, I'm a hyperactive trader, right? I trade the one minute chart for a reason. And so, uh, I have a very tough time holding on to rates longer than a few days. Well, from one week to the next, I go crazy. I have to be flat, usually every day. If it's not every day, it's within, you know, by the next day, by tomorrow, I'm those traits are finished. A swing trade that lasts more than a day or so is uh eating into my sleep, right? So there's behavior attached to all of this, what suits you. What doesn't suit you, what suits your life? If you're a night shift worker. Maybe swing trading is the ticket. It doesn't have to be. The minutia, you know, that knocks you out. As long as you are aware that a 4 hour candle is an average. And you're trading maybe a 4 hour box which contains multiple 4 hour candles. Right, so you could be in that box for 16 hours, 20 hours, 24 hours. You could be in that box for a substantial amount of time. Right, so it's, it's all relative. And understanding when things are failing allows you to move on to your next best rate. So it's not necessarily you that created the failure. Sometimes it's a probability that ran out of time. The fact that it's run out of time frees up the money to go somewhere else. And so all of us have witnessed this before, right? We have a target, maybe we're looking for 40 pips. The market gives you 25, and now you're sitting there waiting to see the missing pips. That never come And the 25 turns to 0. Right, so the time cycle allows you to nip that in the bud, right? So instead of waiting for the 40 that never comes, the time cycle runs out, you take the 25 and you move on. OK, so time cycle is risk management. People neglect this. They don't understand why the X axis is there. The X-axis is Not only does it help the chart, it helps the trader. Create your own time frame. Go look at a 3-day chart or a 3 minute candlestick. Create a box. Trade what the box tells you. And you'll kick ass compared to everybody else around you, because you're using more information to make better decisions. The X-axis serves a purpose. And until that was made clear to me, I was a losing trader. I was barely breaking even. Right, so as soon as I understood time and how it impacts the chart I'm looking at, imagine being an options trader. Right? Theta is huge. The time decay is a huge part of your equation. I don't have to deal with time decay. But I use it. I use time running out as my trade, decaying, it's no longer doing what it was supposed to do. I'm out of here. All right, so understanding where we fit. It's because you're, it suits you, right? You're welcome here. You're welcome on this time frame. A lot of folks are trading out of anxiety. Or fear of missing out. Because they're on the wrong time frame, and they don't know what they're looking for, two very, very, very important criteria. Right, so creating Plan B is still The best risk management you can have, right? Plan B for a swing trader is a is a loss. Small. Cheap Fast failure, right, allows you to take your next sewing tree. What we're learning to do from a scalping standpoint. Is we see the average swings. And we operate with it. So we're under the microscope while the swing trader is looking through a telescope. They're looking outside the boxes, sometimes multiple boxes for their profits. And we're looking within the boxes, sometimes multiple boxes, to make our profits. Right, so it's a different perception. It's the same goal. OK. Any questions? Uh. Yeah, yes, yes, Dillan is asking, uh, Do we count the price and the time cycles in the Asia session? Yes, absolutely. You count the facts. Right, so if the 4 hour chart. No, if you're, um, if you're sitting at the computer, it's 2 o'clock in the morning. And you know, You're trying to calculate 12 swings, and they're on the 4 hour chart. Well, 12 swings may take you into yesterday. Right, so yeah, calculate the facts, don't ignore anything. Uh, distracting the attention from breaking the trades up, not necessarily, it's it. It's the control, right? You, you don't have to go down that path. It's, it doesn't help or make the costs of things any worse, you know, so it's the same. commission, even the commission is broken up into pieces, right? So it's just more control. If you don't need it, don't take it. Right. So, again, when I'm swing trading, it's from an opportunistic standpoint, right? I see the potential for maybe 4 boxes, right? I'm thinking about the blue line. On my whiteboard. Right, I'm thinking about the blue line on my whiteboard. If I'm currently in a 3-ep trade, I'm I'm selling near the top resistance. I can see the potential for maybe 3 to 4 boxes into the future. You know, taking the entry is where the breakup of those clicks are, right? You're breaking up on the entry to get the best price on the way in, or at least an average best price. Right, so if you're deadly accurate with your one click, go for it. But I'm not that good, right? So I'd rather have 4, maybe 8 clicks. 2% for a swing trade, right, but that's, that's pushing the outer limit, right? 2% for a swing trade, that's a lot of money. So yeah, it's to each his own, but you gotta figure out. How it impacts you. Right, so waiting for that trade on a 4 hour chart may just drive you nuts. Right, so just Swing trading is I, uh, you can tune it to suit your needs, right? I've said it before, you can extract your paycheck from the market. It's called a wage, right? Potential average yield. Right. Most people are operating from fear, and they're afraid to cast their line. They're afraid to go fish. No, you have a lot of control over the outcome of your day. It doesn't have to rely on the stock loss. Right. So I hope this helps. I hope this was useful. Like I said, I'll post the document in the uh in the Slack group. It's a PDF file, so download it right away and then, uh, you know, use it. It's like a recipe. All right folks. I'll leave you guys. Thank you, JF. Great job and uh a lot to think about. I'm gonna watch this one again, certainly on the recording, so great job JF and everyone have a very safe day. Yeah, yeah, I'll upload the uh the file right away and then you guys can spend the rest of the day looking at uh some of that information. Great safe, everyone. I'll see you guys uh tomorrow. Enjoy. Bye bye.


## 21 2024 October - Scalping the Futures Markets aac

OK, let me let everybody in one second. OK. You can disable the waiting room too. Um, it's OK for now. Let me see. All right, hello and welcome everybody. Um, today is Wednesday, October 23rd, um, we are here today on our 3 monthly sculpting mastery session. And um today we're um well so I was going to focus on futures, but we, before we start, um I just want to remind you that this is a little bit different from the usual um live sessions. So this time around you can go ahead and um ask questions yourselves. So if you have a question at any point during the session, you just unmute yourself, make sure that, um, so I can hear you. But other than that, um. You can just start talking to him and um ask any questions you have. I would just ask you to uh mute yourselves while uh he's speaking in general while you're just uh listening so that we don't have any interference. But uh with all that being said, welcome and over to you Champ Francois. Uh, good morning. Uh, good afternoon, good evening, everyone. It is October 23rd, 10 o'clock Eastern. The markets have opened about 30 minutes ago. You can see here, oh, am I sharing my screen? No. Let me share screen number 2 and share sound. Share screen number 2. There we go. So, uh, you can see here on my top right hand corner on the 4 minute chart. Market just opened about 30 minutes ago, and since then all we have is a bunch of rejection on both sides, a lot of positioning taking place, right? So I'll, I'll step away from the charts for a few minutes and I'll explain the differences between what I typically do with Forex and what we find ourselves having to do when we're trading futures with this method, OK? So, Taking a step back, let's take a quick look at what the futures contracts are, right? And uh the major differences, right, when we're looking, let's say at the euro, uh, a little further down here, a typical Futures euro contract is €125,000 where a normal CFD spot, no contract is $100,000. And the price per tick, not per pipe, right? Per tick is 625. And so there's a lot more risk involved for every little wiggle. Right? And then when we look at the micros, it doesn't get that much better. Right, $1.25 instead of my regular dollar, right? So, the problem is on the money management side. It's not on, it's not on the box side of the equation. It's what we put in the box, right? So when we go and take a look at the actual chart, and so, sorry, taking a step back from that. Uh, why is it 5FO compared to, you know, non-FIFO, right? Well, if you go and take a look back at when they introduced FIFO, the main thing they were targeting was taking away the inability to martingale. You, you're basically, by forcing FIFO, you don't have as many chances to click, click, click, lick, click, click, click. You don't have 16 clicks. Like I do in a spot market. And if you do try to use 16 clicks, they're all aggregated together. So you end up with one. Average price, right? So you, you lose the luxury of closing trades out of order. And so, basically, you lose the ability to have this anti-martingale strategy, which is what I do, right? Because what tends to happen with my way of trading is when I build a position, I layer in those 16 clicks. When I find that move that I'm looking for within those 16 clicks, all 16 clicks come home. And so basically, I take trade number 1 plus trade number 2, plus trade number 3, plus trade number 4, so on and so forth. It ends up being an anti-M Martingale system, right? So, what I operate is adding to my winners, when people actually see it as adding to losers. This is why I keep highlighting the difference, right? I'm not adding to losers, I'm adding to drawdown. Drawdown eventually turns into a winning trade, which, by definition is anti-martingaling, right? So, now, knowing the differences, if we go and take a look at trading futures, Understanding the expense is built in, uh, let me switch over to microeuros, micro euros during the daytime. Look like this. A lot of gaps, a lot of empty spaces, a lot of nothing, right? So it looks confusing. I don't want to trade this stuff, right? And so I find myself going to maybe uh NASDAQ or the micro NASDAQ MNQ, which is usually what I tend to do. And then with with the MNQ contracts. I'll make sure I'm in my SIM account. And then here, uh, the automatic trade management, I preprogram certain parameters, and I basically shoot for 1 to 1, which would be 20 ticks of stop loss in exchange for a 20 tick target. And I, I'm willing to do it with one contract. Or I preprogrammed 20 by 20 by 2. So that would be two contracts for the same parameters, and then so on and so forth. So I pre-selected a whole bunch of parameters that I, I'm willing to shoot for. And depending on the volatility, I choose whichever one is most appropriate. Typically, I trade futures in the evening before my bedtime, in the Asia session. And so I tend to trade for 40 ticks. At this time of day, the market is moving 40 ticks in the blink of an eye. Right, so it's extremely difficult to move our boxes, to drag our boxes, and so what I tend to do is rely on the grid. Uh, it just moved. It's moving so fast, the grid just moved, but if I measure just one grid, it should be approximately 15 ticks. Right, you can see her. And so, what I tend to do is I try to capture 3 to 4 grids. And likewise, if I'm waiting to get into a trade, I'm waiting for the existing move to have finished 3 to 4 grids, right? So if I go back, why 3 to 4 grids? Well, if I zoom into this. If we go here and we use our ruler. And we start, you know, measuring some of these swings. And so that would be one swing. If I measured the next one and the next one, and the next one, and the next one and the next one, and you average 20 or so of these swings, in the end, you're gonna end up with a box that is about 74 minute bars long, so 7 bars across, and about 15 ticks tall. Right, uh, sorry, yeah, 1515 ticks, uh, 15 points. And so we're looking to capture basically one grid. Uh, where's my ruler? ruler right here. We're trying to capture one of these. 15 62. If you divide this by standard deviation, so what's inside of this split that in two, you end up By 15 by 30. Right, and that's kind of what we're looking for. And if you divide the 4 minute chart into 1 minute. So you have 4 times more bars. And then you look at this as your intermediate time frame. Right, so this would be the equivalent to our daily chart. What is the daily bar doing compared to the one before? And you look at this here, you can see we're bouncing off the lows, and we're 2 bars into the bounce. What does it look like over here? We're multiple bars in, right? For every 1 minute bar, we should have 4 15 seconds. So you can see how we're breaking down 14 minute candle. Into 16. 15 2nd candles. All right, and so one grid here. is approximately 3 to 4 grids here. And within 3 to 4 grids, there's approximately 16 bars. Right? And now, depending on which contract you choose to shoot at, uh, you could be moving 6789 $1000 in 3 to 4 grids, right? It's extremely expensive, and it's extremely important that you be patient, because you don't have 16 clicks to try, try, try and try again. Right? So, you'll notice it's moving very rapidly. I'm not gonna draw a box. I'm not gonna drag the box around. I'm just gonna rely on where we are within the grid. And how many grids that we moved, right? So when we're looking at it this way, it's kind of dynamic, it's extremely liquid, it changes all the time. If I just do this, the grid changes. Right, so you could be in the middle of a trade, and all of a sudden you end up with something like this. Oh, what just happened? What what happened to my grid? Right? And so this is the problem, uh, you know, trading in a discretionary fashion, right? Hence, I have the indicators. I don't trade with, I don't trade the indicators. I kind of lean on them to, uh. Confirm what I'm thinking, right? So when this is bearish, or making lower highs, lower lows, and we're below all three moving averages, which I'll touch on in a minute. At the same time, the stochastic is below 50 and remains below 50. Right, uh, you'll notice I have 3 moving averages on all 3 time frames. I'm not trading the crossovers or anything like that. I'm only looking at the moving averages as a point of reference, which way is north. Right, so if I'm below the orange line, On this particular time frame. I'm below all of them. I, I'm, I'm bearish. If I happen to be below the orange line here, and above on the intermediate time frame, You'll notice you're gonna find yourself in a quandary. It's like you're, oh, I'm not sure if I should be bullish or bearish. Lean in the direction of the higher time frame. Right, so if you're, if you find yourself debating which is which, which one to follow, follow the higher time frame. Right? And then on the 15 seconds chart, you basically are just reacting to price, right? You're taking advantage of 3 to 4 boxes and maybe a sell for 1 box. Right? And then here all this something else maybe we should talk about, uh. Because I'm operating such a a tight time frame, I favor selling the ask, buying the bid, instead of trading at market. And it's just something I've gotten accustomed to. You don't have to do that. You can play at market, right? So right now, you notice I have my ATM set for 44. Ticks on the side, 44 ticks on the target side, and I traded with one contract. Right, so my stop is right there, my entry is right here. My exit is right there. Extremely efficient market. Right, so if I was to look at the depth of market, I would see my entry right here. I would see myself as a market participant. Right? And everybody else is seeing my stop right there. Everybody else sees my my limit order sitting there. Stop filled. Right. So one contract, 44 ticks, cost me $22. OK, so you could see the expense, right? It's built in. Right? So now, if we use multiple contracts and everything goes to the pooper, it's multiples of this, and it can be extremely, extremely devastating in the blink of an eye. Right, so at the open right here. You tend to get T-boned, right? So avoid the open if you can. Wait about 30 minutes. Better yet, if you wait 35 minutes or so, because at the top of the hour is the options expiry, and you want to be out of, uh, you don't want to take part during that, right? So wait about 5 minutes past the top of the hour. And then you'll notice things settle down. You have directionality. Right, you have intent, and it's not just all over the place. OK, so, price and time cycle. All right, let's go back to this for a minute. When we're measuring these swings, On the euro We're repeating the same 2 hour window, more or less, you know, we encompass the 2 hour window, so we want to make sure we're capturing the swings that we will be trading every day. Do the same thing here, right? So, like for me, I trade in the aftermarket mostly. Before bedtime. And so, I tend to measure the environment that's slow and quiet, stuff like this. And that's where my box comes from. If you're going to be trading in North America, you're going to be trading stuff like that, very different environment. And the cost, the expense of being wrong here is very different compared to this. Right, so it's, you have to pick your poison and and really be uh Business oriented, trade like a businessman. I have a plan, an exit, and be committed to your execution. There's this is not a world for amateurs, right? It's, this is, uh, hence I, I make my money trading Forex and I learned to trade on futures. Like, literally, I'm still learning to do this stuff here, right, because I'm operating out of fear. The fear of loss is tremendous here. I've bitten, I've been bitten, I guess, once bitten twice shy. Right, so let's try that again. And see if we can make back that $22 right? Our extremely efficient market has me sitting there with a bull's eye. On my back, right? Everybody sees my stop. In a 1 to 1 environment, I'm as, it's a fifty-fifty, you know, I, I'm as uh. Lucky to get taken out as I am to make money. Right, let's see if I add to this, you will notice what FIFO does. Order filled, right. So automatically it added to my contract. It averaged the new entry with the existing entry, so the price moved up a little bit. My stop stayed put and my target stayed put. So the only thing that changed is the average price. And now I've doubled my risk. If I'm correct in my assessment, and we are heading in this direction. I'll make my $22 plus $22. Right? If I'm wrong, I'll lose another 44. Right, and so I don't want to touch the stop loss. I wanna be part of the market, right? I don't, I don't wanna risk my account, so I'm gonna leave everything as is, and we'll see if I become uh a statistic or not. Right, if, uh, do I have the depth of market on here? Sorry, it's opening up on my other monitor. Uh Dynamic depths, there it is. Yeah, yeah, yeah, uh. Antoine is asking a question in the in the uh scalp in the uh chat box there. If If the strategy needs to be adapted, yes, absolutely, absolutely. There's no uh This is, this, these are not rules to trade. These are guidelines to adapt. To the market, it's for you to. Think things through in a in a more uh probability driven. My like way of thinking. Right, so we're just using probabilities to line to to stack the deck, right? And then it allows us to put money on the right side. It doesn't have to be 100%. We're not looking for deadly accuracy. Right? We're just learning to lose like a professional, right? So instead of relying on hopes and prayers, we're relying on probabilities and statistics. That's it. Target filled and it doesn't have, oh, there you go. So we made our money back. All right, let's try that again. Order filled. And see if we can make another 404 ticks. And so ideally, we're not trying to rock the world. We're not gonna make a million bucks in one day, but you can definitely lose a million dollars in a day. Right? So don't think you're invincible because the market, you look how quickly it moves, right? And if I click on this, we can actually see it in dollars. There we go. Stub filled. And so I just took a loss. Let's try selling it again. Right. The reason why I'm selling is because I am on the 4 on the on my highest of the time frame. I am below all three moving averages. And here I am below all three moving averages, and now it's changing. You can see how everything's changing. We're now crossing one, crossing the other. Right? 3 boxes or To standard deviation, we're approaching 3, if we can get into the upper half here. There we go, right? 3 standard deviations, so a little bit of a pullback, a little bit of a retracement, you probably want to buy that. Boom right filled. All right, and if it pulls back a little bit more, back to this orange line, I'll buy another. Or filled. Right, so see here. If we can stay above the green line, we're targeting the orange. You can throw any moving average you want in there, right? I just happened to use 7. 25 In 99. Stub filled filled. Right, so you can see the expense, you can see how precision is kind of necessary here. If you have the patience to wait the two boxes and click at the edge. You're better off. If you click in the middle of the box, if you click in, you know, in, in the middle of the candle. You're exposing yourself to that volatility. And you'll notice from even trading Forex, the move tends to come at the end of the candle, not at the front end of the candle, right? So even on the 15 2nd candlestick, the, the, the bulk of the move comes near the end of the 15 seconds. Right, so the, the problem we're going to have. Is your willingness to keep clicking, yeah. I know I'm right in the end. If I just add another trade. If I just add another trade, if I just add another trade, eventually this becomes unruly and unmanageable, just one standard deviation. It's just way too much money. And it's, there's no way out of this, right? You'll notice all my trades are aggregated. I oops sorry. There is no way for me to get out of this one trade at a time. Like I do in Forex. when I trade Forex, I can close trades out of sequence. I can trade my I can close my last trade first. I can't do that here, right, the 4th click. is part of the first click. I can't close them out of sequence. If I change this, So now I, I look for maybe a 44 by 20 and I buy filled. I now have 5 contracts and the exits are different on that 5th. Because I asked for different parameters. To filled. Right. And so this idea of fivefold first in, first out, there lies the problem, right? It takes away your ability to engineer break even. Right, because now it's engineered for you. Right, and there's no way out of that. If I buy again right now filled. And I buy a second one. Or filled. So the two are averaged together. I'm using 44 by 20, so it's a 2 to 1 trade. And I'm using 2 contracts. Right, we're below the moving averages. It's highly likely not going to work, right? Below the moving averages, below the moving averages. Right, not going to work. Over here, we were above the moving averages. And that did not last long. Right. How many boxes? 3. How many boxes on the way down. 3. Right, we're all inside one box over here. We're all inside one box over here. Oops. There we go. Price and time cycle. Count the number of bars on average, there will be about 7 per cycle. And there should be about 7 bars in that box at 123456777 bars in the box. It's Order filled, filled. Do it 2 times. If I just do it one time. An ad right there filled. So we have a higher low. Right here, high or low. Are we gonna try and make a higher high? Oh we're gonna try and make a lower low. So, We can check, uh. Stub filled Or it keeps opening up over there. Uh, it's not even active, wrong contracts. So yeah, let's buy that again, that again. Let's minimize this out of the way. Right, so going back to going back to this FIFO stuff. Order filled. We're inside the one box. And because we expect a break, we expect a break, the break should lead another box, right? So if we get filled, if we are breaking or filled, we might be going up 3 boxes over here, right? 3 to 4 boxes. Standard deviation, so to speak, right? I'm relying on the machine doing the math, right? I'm relying on the computer, figuring out the high, the low, and dividing it in such a way that it gives us Even spacing. Even spacing is an average. That's all it is, and we are trading averages. Right, so here's that break into the upper box we're looking for. Right there. Target filled. So if that's the case, if that's the case, we now recycle, no, if you want to call it that, recycle the trays that keep closing. Right, stochastic is above 50. We're turning up heading towards 50. One contract. Let's see if I had a. Automatically it averages together. Maybe we could switch it to a positive versus reward ratio. Target filled. 40 by 80. So 40 for loss, 80 for profit, one contract at a time. Order filled. Right, so that becomes a 2 to 1 risk to reward ratio. If it pulls back a little bit, no, I can probably take another trade. We're still relying on price and time cycles, and we're relying on an average move, whether in price or in time. To make a decision. And because this is happening so rapidly, the moving average helps like a compass. It helps to see where north is on this time frame. Right, so it's positioning, and then within that positioning, within that ballpark, it becomes price and time cycles. You're targeting one or the other, and the number of bars slash number of pips. All we're trying to do is Pick an average move and extract from it. We're not trying to be at the top, we're not trying to be at the bottom. We happen to find the top, and we happen to find the bottom because of price and time cycles. Right, we, we don't look for them, we just, we're guided there. All right, and the thing here with futures, extremely efficient market. Right, so everybody sees everybody else's orders, uh, you will feel targeted, you know, there's no other way about it. You are targeted, everybody is. Right, so we become part of the market. Uh, my order is part of the order book, right? My limits, my stops, everything here is part of the order book. Everybody sees everybody else's moves. I don't care to look for the level 2 data. I don't care to look for volume profiling or any of that stuff. In reality, you could also get rid of the indicators. No, I care for average moves. And in the case of futures, I happen to do it on the smallest of the time frame. Uh, it allows me to manage risk. To the nth degree, because I can't do it to the ends dollar. When I'm trading Forex, I can tune my risk to dollars and cents. When I trade futures, I had to use time to control risk. Right, so we made it from one to the other, right? We made it into the upper box here. And so that's 2 standard deviations or 1.5 so far. Let's see if we can get the other half. I made it to standard deviations over here. Let's see if we can make it a 3rd. Oops, sorry, I changed it. Right, and if I add contract, I'm in the money right here. If I add a contract in the money, filled, it averages with the existing contract. Right? If I add a contract when we're out of the money, same thing, right? So the break even is averaged. It's, it's a it's the dollar cost average. This is DCA trading. OK. So how many ticks are we here? 8:30. 8 points And this is like looking at pets. Target filled Right, so we're slowly eating away at our losses. Alright, let's see a little bit of a retracement. If it doesn't retrace, there's no, there's no chasing, there's no jumping into this. Right, so we're waiting for a red candle. I'll buy the bid if I can. We want to buy stuff when it's cheap, not when it's expensive and getting expensive or like more expensive. Thank you. Call us thrifty. Right here, we're approaching the level where we would expect some kind of resistance. 2 standard deviations. Right, that makes sense. Same thing here. 2.5. If you start from here, it's almost 3 standard deviations. There's the entry we're looking for. Or filled. Right, I'm buying at the bid. So I got the better price. Somebody who thinks this is going down. Basically sold it to me. I can close it manually. Order filled. Right. I can switch my position. I'm not looking for huge tremendous targets, right? I'm not swing trading. Or filled. 2 to 1. 40 ticks of loss for 80 ticks of profit. I'm trading with one contract at a time. Positioning, you can see. As long as we remain above that yellow moving average, which just happens to highlight previous support. We're bullish, and not bullish to the moon, but to this next area of support slash resistance. Right, so it's one step at a time. It's like the ladder that we have in the forex. Environment Think of this here as the latter. And we're just watching price go up the ladder. You can replace these moving averages with your favorite ones. It's just a point of reference. We're not trading the moving average, right? We're not trading. The crossings or anything like that. It's price. In reference to a level filled. Right, so here we are, it's just going to hold, right, is this level going to hold? I suspect it might order filled. Let's see what happens next. In reality, what you're trying to do is capture standard moves, right? Standard moves, something like this, something like this. If you draw, if you draw, uh, where is it? My line, there it is. If we draw this right there. And then you'll notice this thing, there's a half of one. This this big move here is 2 of these. The next move after that was one of those. Right, the next move after that. Was one of these. Standard moves. We're just looking for standard moves. I happen to be targeting a standard move right now. Right, so we find Matt's support. I should get paid a standard move. My job is to test for support, just like I do in the world of Forex, except I don't have 16 clicks to find it. Right, I could draw a box here, but I've spent half my day moving it, and I would not be trading. And this is just too quick, and if I slow down, if I trade the 1 minute chart or I trade the 5 minute chart, it becomes too expensive for my personal taste, right? Maybe not for you. Uh I just picked this up back here. Right out of the blue. Right here. And it happens to be exactly what we're looking for. Just No, standard move. Nothing more, nothing less. If it looks good, if it looks like it repeats over and over and over, like if you look at this over here. This little move right there. Oops, this little move right there. You can use it over and over and over and over. Even on the way down. Like this, this area here. It's basically one box. Right, so the key is to understand what the average is. And exploit it in both directions. Right? So, direction is no longer the problem. It helps to be on the right side. It makes things simpler, you know, less aggravation. But it doesn't stop you from making money, right? So basically, if you fall off the horse, it's OK to get back on and continue trading. If we can't make a higher high here, if we cannot make a higher high, it might be wise to take a loss manually. Instead of testing to see if the 44 ticks hold, or 40 ticks. Right, so think of this as 2 steps forward, one step back, you're just trying to be more precise when to choose to take a step. Right. Considering the yellow here is holding, so previous support is holding. It makes sense to look for the next area of resistance. Up here. All right, that's all we're trying to do. And we're doing it standard moves at a time. So this we're looking at 4066. 4066 is two of these. Right, just eyeballing it. We're not looking for precision, you know, we just want to be. In and out in the right ballpark. Precision comes down to your discipline and your execution. I don't expect it from the market side of the equation. Oops. I keep doing this. There we go. And then you can choose to book profits earlier, you don't have to wait for the target. You know, I don't have to have a 2 to 1 tree. It's nice to have a 2 to 1 trade, but it's not a necessity. That's another big misconception. And this is what we learned to trade Forex with 4 boxes. Looking for an average move, right? We, we can use space to get the job done. Here, space is harder to come by. It's more expensive, it's like real estate almost. And so you're using standard deviations, right? Standard deviation right here. And you're exploiting these standard moves. Right, so, as we speak, we've moved from one box into the next box. And we're looking to see if we can test the top of it. Right. Much like we tested this year. If I add a contract, order filled. It averages it to the existing contract. If I add a order filled, it keeps averaging, it keeps moving up to average filled. So now I'm at 4 contracts. Watch it turn around and come and get me out. Yeah. That's that feeling threatened, you know, feeling targeted. All right there. This is the level we're using. This is the level we're working off of. I'll take another one there, right, so I'm averaging Order filled. I took another trade down here, and the price dropped. Right, so now I have 5 contracts aggregated together. I must cross over the aggregate and the break even. In order to make any kind of money. If I choose to close them out of sequence. If I choose to close them out of sequence. Then it, it's the the software, the machine. Will close my worst loser on my behalf, right? So if I try to book a profitable trade right now, the machine will close my worst loser instead. If I try to close the 2nd best winning trade, it will close the 2nd worst loser, so on and so forth, right? The machine will keep removing losing trades instead of removing winning trades. That's basically first in, first out, right? If you're trying to close your last trade, that's winning right now, it will remove the first trade you took on, basically your worst loser. There's no other way out. And it's just close all of this. Or filled. I said the down to 29 bucks. We're almost at the top, we're almost at resistance on the higher time frame. Right, the intermediate time frame is telling us the same thing. It's just, you know, a little bit more oops. A little bit more precise, or more detailed, I should say. Right here. Same, same, same, same, same, same, same. Right, so a little bit of a pullback, a little bit of a retracement, one box maybe. Right. Price and time cycle wise on the 15 seconds chart, my box comes from the higher time frame, right? So the boxes that you see here. is made up of 4 or 5 of these little ones. And we're just trying to capture portions of that. Right? Price action is still what you're trading, but you're relying on the number of bars. To gauge How long you should be sticking around. Right, if the number of bars is beyond the average, nothing's happening, it's likely doing this, going sideways. And basically, instead of going north or south, it's going east. It it's. Uh, it's exploiting price and time cycle, except it's exploiting time in particular, right? It's wasting time. And so the key here is to see the time on the wall, the clock, and to operate like a business, right? Wasting time does not make you money. So we're still waiting to get that resistance. Right around here probably. Order filled. Good place to sell. Right, so now I'm selling 2 to 1. I have 1 unit of risk, 2 units of profit. If I have 1 or 2 bars of profit, I'll probably take a second target. I mean a trade. Right, so I have a, it's like we do in Forex, this anti Martingale. Anti martingale means you're adding to winning trades. Adding to winning trades. And it's more difficult here because they're in aggregate. So now remember the idea of Precise execution. Jumping the gun. I don't want to touch my stock, right? I don't want to even move it a fraction away. I want to have Standard-sized losses. So it's like I made a commitment to myself years ago. I want to lose the same amount over and over and over. I choose the number of clicks at that amount. Right, just postpones the risk of ruin. If I randomize my losses, if I have losses of different sizes all the time, big, small, indifferent. I'm more or less inviting ruin. Right, so I guess you can Say it's more about the control. You guys have any questions out there? How am I measuring the average move so quickly? Uh, maybe because I've been doing it for years. Uh, someone's asking me in a direct message, how am I measuring this so quickly? Uh, it's, no, I've been doing this for two decades, but at the same time, if you zoom out, you'll notice it's trading, it's not a line, it's a ribbon. Right, we, we see it as a fine line that goes up and down. I see it as a ribbon. Right, so it's like 1 centimeter wide and it's heading down. And then it's 1 centimeter wide and it's heading up. I see it as a range, it's a wide, it's a piece of tape. And most people are zoomed in, most people are zoomed in, and they only see the price, right? They only see the price. I see the range. I, I see the width, the high and the low, and what's in between. Right, so what's in between is the standard move. The width of the ribbon is the standard move. And so it's a perception. It's all the way, it's the way you see risk, it's the way you see price. It's The way you want to take a piece of it, but you're patient enough to wait. It's almost the way it's the same way a firefly targets a bug, you know, if you, if you Wikipedia fireflies or if you go to the, you know, the uh Uh, what you call it? Check the encyclopedia and look up, you know, fireflies, how they hunt bugs. It's the same thing we're doing here. We're hunting the market the same way a firefly filled hunt some mosquito. We Anticipating the next move, and calculating where it's supposed to happen, and we position ourselves there. And then we just let the market come to us. Right, we set the trap. We, it's like a trip wire, and we allow the market to trip over the wire. The firefly hunts the same way. It doesn't chase the mosquito. It's, it measures its path and figures out where it's heading, and it positions itself there. Right, so same thing we're doing here. I, I'm anticipating the market is dropping because of where we were and what should come of this, and that's what we're doing here. We're exploiting that exploiting that next move. So we went from $250 and The red to turning $60. Order filled with a little bit of room to go. Alright, we still have about 10 more minutes. And so the key here is to, you know, Understand the horse will try to buck you off. You have to get back on the horse. And you know, try to continue. To, you know, get that 3 pips, 3 pips, 3 peps. In theory, you only have so much money to work with, so you can only afford so many losses in a row. And that's what you're tracking. Right, so in the back of my mind, I'm always counting the number of losses in a row. Right, so if I have 2 in a row, 3 in a row, 4 in a row, I'm starting to be really anxious, like something's off. I'm, I'm maybe today is not my day, right? But in, in theory, what we're doing is very, very high probability. And so to have 1 loss, maybe 2 in a row, that's OK, but to have a series of them is improbable. So that raises flags. Right, and then if you keep having these series of losses, Step away from the market in general, right, reassess what you're doing. There's, there's something wrong with your process. what we're exploiting is the law of large numbers, that's all it is. It's a way of filtering out low probabilities and only acting on the high probability. And that's not high certainty. Right, it's high probability. There's still chances of loss. I lose all the time, but I don't lose everything. Right, there's the difference. I used to lose everything. Right. I used to lose it all. Now I know when to stop losing. I know when to stop winning. I know when to walk away, and I prefer to trade futures in the evening because it simplifies all of this. Right? When I trade futures in the daytime like this, it's whipsaw City like you saw here today. And when I trade futures in the evening, it's like trading Forex in the Asia section. It's methodical, it's measured. I don't want to use risk less, but it's easier to gauge the risk, right? So, uh, think of it as a pre-defined zone that you can kind of milk. Uh, to your heart's content, where right now, anybody can come along, plop a billion dollars on the market. For whatever reason, right? It's their daytime market. When I'm trading in the aftermarket, it's rare. It has to be risk driven for something like that to happen. Right, so what I'm trying to do is just stay in line with The market's ability to pay, right? 12, see the grids in the background, we're 2.24 grid. No, I'll take it. Order filled. Made $100 today, made $90 today. Maybe I'll try buying this. Or filled. Why am I buying this? Because of where we are here. Right, we came down one box. We're at the bottom of the grid now, so I'm thinking maybe we can come back up. Right? Imagine the 4 minute chart. Contains 16 of these. Right, there's 16 of these 15 2nd bars. No, just a quick interruption. We only have a couple more minutes left, so we need to be looking at starting to wrap up. Oh, OK. So yeah, uh, how are you measuring the averages? Oh yeah, so we did, we answered that question, uh. So yeah, if you're going to be trading with futures, focus on the time cycle, right? So, whatever strategy you're already currently doing, whatever it is that you're doing right now, that you're, you know, favoring every morning, your, you know, favorite way of Making money Start introducing the number of bars on average, right? The number of bars in this little leg up right there. This little leg up right there, this little leg up right there, right? Start averaging these types of things together, right? This average with this average with this gives you an average leg up. And I bet you this average leg up will make reference to this, and this, and even what we have here, and what we're about to do today right now. Right? An average move is all we're trying to target, except in the future's world, it's megabucks. And so I do it with minis or micros, and I try to do it, you know, when it's less risky in the evening. Right, so I manage risk using time. Time of day and the number of bars, right? Time. It's a way of looking at things without putting money on without. Putting emotions to the money, right? There's no emotions connected at the time. So it's easier for me to manage risk when I look at the clock rather than my pocketbook. All right, so anyways, top of the hour, if I can close this right now and $4 I'll be happy. Right, there we go. So be it. Any questions before I go? OK. Probably not right now. I don't see anything more coming in, um, but so everybody, just remember if you have any questions that come up afterwards, you can always put them in the um elite scalping channel. Just, um, ask in there and Jean Francois will answer and of course we'll be back tomorrow for the regular uh live session and you can always ask um during that one as well. Yeah, so it's, remember it's time cycle, right? So it's an average number of bars, and on any time frame you choose, you could do this, for example, you know, on the hourly. And all of a sudden these average moves are now thousands of dollars, and your anxiety will go through the roof, right? So, find yourself on the level or in a price chart that you can actually afford at least one swing. And because you don't have 16 clicks anymore, one swing is more than sufficient for 2 clicks, you know, which is all you pretty much need. OK, so remember to just dollar cost average. While you're in drawdown, right? Not booking losses upon losses upon losses, you're not averaging losses. And you're averaging an open working trade, and that gives you the freedom, right? The problem is, is once you have that second trade in there, that's it, you're committed, right? You cannot start closing them out of sequence. So keep that in mind and limit your exposure by limiting the number of clicks, use. Decisiveness, use precision, you know, be more patient and you'll, you'll be OK. Right? So, if we go from the bottom of the drawdown to the top of what we did here, we did about $300. No, if I, I did not be from the losses up front, we would have been OK. So, anyways, I'll let you guys go and I'll see everyone in the chat. Enjoy yourselves, folks. Trade safe everyone. All right, thank you, buddy. See you tomorrow. Bye bye. Yeah, bye bye.


## 22 2024 November - Camarilla Pivots A Scalper s Secret Weapon aac

1 and R2. And S2 And so, when you have traditional pivots, they tend to be too far away, right? So if you're waiting to get to a pivot to take a trade in the bond market, He was waiting too long. He was taking too few traits, not enough traits. And so he needed to tighten up the pivots. He needed to bring the pivots closer to the current price. And so what he's done is he took the pivot and applied a multiplication factor. And so basically the range becomes a little bit tighter. And this is now a mechanical approach, right? The formula never changes, it's the input data that changes. Right? So by adding new data every day, you get new pivots for tomorrow, right? So, today, we are working with yesterday's data, right? So if you go through this, it explains how to calculate the pivots. And here at the bottom, I can walk you through how we would use them uh in a 24 hour period, right? Because as a Forex trader, our market is open 24 hours a day. And it starts at 5 o'clock New York, right? So this would be 5 o'clock New York, right here, right, 5 p.m. in New York. That would be the beginning of the Asia session. Right? Typically very low volatility, nothing really to write home about. Most of you that trade the European session, you're trading here at the end of the Asia session and at the beginning of the European session, and you're usually faced with a false move at one end or the other before you are faced with the real move. And you can see how over time, the daily candle starts to get bigger and bigger and bigger. And by the time I come to work in North America, I'm left. With the wick at the end of the day, or down here somewhere. Right? But it's, it's an evolution. It grows over 24 hours, right? So, but it starts on schedule. It starts on time. T 0 PI 0. Right, so the day begins at 0 pips, and we end up maybe with a, you know, 60 5th day at the end. Right? But it had to start from zero, and we had to find a low. We had to find a high, we had to find a lower low, and then eventually we finished with a higher high and closed. Away from there, typically 2 boxes. Right, so, over time, It looks like this. And within the day, sometimes we're faced with our own little expanding, expanding, uh, wedges like this, right? So the key to all of this is time. And adjusting your expectations appropriately, right? So if you live in Europe and you trade the euro, this is your currency. You're bound to be faced with the trend. If you live in Asia and you trade the euro, you're typically have no business to do with the euro. There's no commerce happening with the euro. You have yen in your pocket, you're doing business in yen. So the euro is very slow, boring almost. And when we come in in North America, there's a lot of business happening between Europe and North America. Right? So the commerce taking place is the volatility that we're experiencing, right? So we can, we can anticipate. Just by looking at the calendar, what kind of move this may end up looking like, you know, if you have, uh, let's say the ECB scheduled for, uh, you know, to release their interest rates, you may end up up here somewhere. And then when the US comes along, you may end up doing something like this, right? That little wick. And so you end up with a big megaphone, right? But it started out at T0. And Piper, and it had to grow. And so in order for this to take In order for you to take part in this, you want to be positioning yourself, literally the same slice of time every day. And so if you use that slay slice of time every day, every day, you may be faced with a short, or depending on what's happening, maybe the flip side, and you're faced with the long. You're near. The same pivots, right? So you're near the same bank of pivots. From day to day. Does that make sense? Right? So what we're looking for is to find our start time. If I happen to be starting at 8 o'clock in the morning, I come in at 8 o'clock in the morning, I look to my left, I want to see how did the pivot come about. How did the price react to the pivots, and which pivot am I at now currently? And so the current pivot gives me something to lean into. And now I can maybe expect to move up, or if it fails to go up, maybe I can expect to move to L5. Right? So these are now mathematical targets. So instead of me having to look to the left, To pick and choose what levels may be important in the past, and extend the line and draw a ladder like I've been teaching you to. If you don't want to draw the ladder, you can refer to the pivots as the latter and let the pivot. Tell you what the next move may be. Right? So, the mathematics is really, really simple. The use is extremely simple. I will get to that here in a second. Uh, I wanna move this down. Here we go. Right, so in order to use this, There's a couple of scenarios. One is a breakout and one is a range. And when it's a range, it's typically at the front end of the 24 hours, right? The range is usually found in the Asia session. We can see that here. Right, scenario two tends to play itself out in in the later sessions, the 2nd or the 3rd session of the day, right? So, depending on where you are, depending on which instrument you're trading, this is evolving at the same rate, right? T0, Pip 0. The direction is what you're trying to figure out. Right, so Pick your scenarios based on what is happening. One is a breakout, one is a range trade. You can see that here, right? You're trapped between L3. You're playing the range. If you break out of L3. So now you're at L4. You are targeting L5 as the next leg up, right? So it's like going up the ladder. Right? So if L3 fails, or sorry, L4 is resistance if it holds, you're coming back down, right? So you're basically trying to find a break of L4. This is when I happened to come in at 10 o'clock Eastern, right around here. Right, so it, it It happens to be a measured environment because we have an expected ADR average daily range. And we can look to the left, we can see how much we've done so far, and we're trying to figure out what is left. To be done Right? So by looking at which pivots we're leaving behind, we can assume which pivot we're heading towards, right? So if we look at the charts, And I'll go to the 15 minutes. This is what it looks like for today on the euro. And there's behind this red line here, there's the gray line, happens to be the daily pivots. They just happen to be stacked on top of each other. Right, but if I squish in a little bit, we can see all of the levels, right? So the beginning of the day, T0, PI 0. We headed into This H3 short, and you can see it labeled short, right? So Camarilla pivots are the only pivot. That have a call to action associated. OK, if you look at uh the Mark pivots or Fibonacci pivots or traditional pivots, it just says, you know, R1 S1. It doesn't tell you what to do there, right? You have to have a plan already fabricated in in the back of your mind. These Camarilla pivots. The mechanical Feature It is the same function over and over and over and over, right? So if you get to this level, you're, you're expected to bounce here, and instead, we had a break. So clearly the pivot failed to hold. It did bounce with that one little candle, 15 minutes, but that's not really a bounce, is it? It failed. And where did we go to? We went to short breakup. We bounced a little bit here. Eventually, short breakout failed to hold, and if it fails to hold, where do we go next? Short breakout target. And that's a mathematical target. Right, so it's a function of yesterday's price action. We look to get to this point based on yesterday. And so if today is similar, we should get there. And you'll see the blue line. Means we've already reached the average daily range. We have fulfilled the average, and I can see average today is 87, and the average for the week so far is 86. Right? So, this tells me the next step, you know, what should I expect or anticipate next? It's mechanical in nature. And when I discovered these pivots, I was looking to standardize my approach. When I saw the formula, it's like, ah, that's exactly what I've been looking for, right? It standardizes my drawing the lines. And if I, if I only care for horizontal lines, my decision making is now binary, right? It's either a bounce or it's not. It either holds or it doesn't. It's a good trait or it's not. There's no questioning what's happening. Just do the task, do the job, follow the label, right? So let me turn on the history on here. And so we can see some of yesterday's pivots and the day before. Right, so yesterday, We opened T0 PI0. The Asia session was contained to L3 and H3 or H3 and L3, sorry. H3 bounced. But did not go to the moon. Eventually, H3 failed. Oh sorry, L3 failed. We went down to L4, L4 tells you if this fails to hold, the target is here, and we've almost made it to the target. Right, so that's one day. Today looks very, very similar to that, right? The day before, we opened T0 PI 0, we went to H3. H3 says to bounce, so we bounced. We tried it again, we bounced. We tried it again, it failed. We broke through, tried it again. It Bounce, right, we came down. Eventually we made it to uh uh age 4. H4 tells you if we break this level, target H5. And we made it to H5. OK, so basically it's a road map. If you get to one step, the binary decision making takes you to the next step. And you basically have to uh accept defeat when you're wrong, because following the trade plan on on the playbook here. And if we follow the trade plan, it tells you where to put your stop loss, right? So basically you hide your stop at the previous pivots. So if you're leaving behind H3, and you're now at age 4, targeting H5, you put, if you open a trade at age 4, you put your stop at age 3. Right, so it's a step and repeat, step and repeat, and the same thing kind of. Um, regenerates itself every 24 hours, right? So at the end of today, It will take today's high, today's low, and today's closing price. To create tomorrow's pivots. And then we trade tomorrow's pivots, which don't move. The pivots do not change, they stay put. So it's a binary approach to trading ranges. Right, so in theory, uh, it's very, it's limited. In, in, uh, Uh, And, and what can go bad, you know, like you, it the the range is defined. You have your ceiling, you have your floor, you have your expectations. If you price your money based on what H, uh, the levels are, you know, the extremes. Did we just need this. There we go. There we go. That's better. If we just take the extremes. As legitimate and figure out your 4% off of those limits. 1% per box, you can plan a hedge, you know, that's kind of what we do with Plan B, Plan C, Plan D, and the boxes. So if you combine this with the boxes, you can find yourself stacking the boxes to move between these levels. Right? So, the plan kind of tells you what to do. If you get here, a short breakout. So if we break this red line, You're targeting this red line, short breakout target. The same thing happens on the opposite side, right? If we break this green line, we target this green line. And it's mechanical. There's no ifs and buts about it. Right, uh, you just put your target there and you take it. Well, in this case, you would have taken a little bit less, taken a little bit less, taken a little bit less. Right, it's all based on yesterday's price action. If we try a different instrument, oops sorry, let's go, let's see, no, something like that's been moving quite a bit. So you can see from a day, day to day. We broke the 4th, made it to the 5th, broke the this is the 3rd, the 4th. Never made it to the 5ths. Right, it failed to break and came back. shut that up. There you go, right? So if you look back to the history, every time we break the 4th, we strive to get to the 5th. For 5th, 4 5th. 4 Never made it, actually came back. This was a fail. Right, this one here, we made it to the red, and instead of Breaking, it actually bounces, right? That's what it's supposed to do. That's money to be made here. Right? Our approach 3 pips, 3 pips, 3 pips. This is tacking boxes, maybe 2 to 3 boxes. OK, so as the price moves through the pivots, as the price moves through the pivots, we are stacking boxes and following along. Right, so it's a roadmap as to the potential. Day unfolding, right? We know we have ADR, we have an average to meet. It so happens that the average is within the target, so there's a probability of success there. Right. Uh, I think we talked about the daily pivots, that would be the gray line. Right, that gray line is is present every day. That's the, that's the basic pivot, you know, it's the traditional pivot, high, low, closed divided by 3. And day by day, that is a high probability target and it tends to be. Counter trend to the previous close. OK, so the pivot. was above yesterday's clothes. Trend Counterre. Right, so in order to get to the pivot, you had to trade counter trend. Right, so this is where people get all messed up, right? Sometimes the pivot is pointless, like here. We never made it to that pivot, and we missed this pivot for 1 or 1234 days. we made it 5 days, 4 days later. And so when we miss a pivot, Keep it highlighted on your chart, and you may get there eventually. So, the problem with pivots is you sometimes overcommit, you know, you're, you're kind of married to the idea that it will get there. Uh, it's gotta get there. There's no other choice. Well, there's lots of choice. And this is the problem, right? We have to know when we're wrong, and this is why with that, that trade plan there, uh, It tells you where to put your stops, and you kind of have to obey the trade plan. You can't, you can't really be second guessing the mechanical approach. And so you'll see a lot of what I do, uh, well, you probably won't see it because this is MT4 and I don't run MT4 that often anymore, but, uh. What I used to do was this. I can assure you that here. Let's remove this one. Right, so I put 2 time frames side by side. I put Camarella pivots for the day. And I put Camarilla pivots for the week. The weekly pivots. They basically look at last week's high low close. And they apply the formula to the weak, right? So now I have weekly targets. If I break, like you can see right here, we bounced off that green line. For days. And this is the, the short target. This is the bounce to go short level. And if we're going short, the next Target for the week. Is this 4700. And that's a mathematical target. There's nothing that says it will get there. It's just based on volatility. The potential exists, right? And if we get to this, The label says to bounce. Right, the label says to go along. Will bounce, unless it's a break. If it's a break, we get to the 50% line. From the big, big swing, it also happens to be a breakout level. So if we break this second red line, We're now heading here. No, or 3. Uh, very unlikely, right? There's only tomorrow left. How far are we? Unlikely that we do 220 pips in one day. It's more probable that tomorrow we may end up down here. 50 pips away. 4700, right? So it's bound between these two pivots until we break. And you'll notice on this particular setup, I have ichimou. Ithimoku is a trend trading tool. And Camarilla pivots are range training tools. And so here I combine both. And so within one. Within one chart, I can tell the trend, and I can tell the ranges within the trend. Right. Down trend. And I'm, I'm stuck between these pivots. Until we break out of these pivots, it's a range. Right? So, a lot of information can be gathered by just looking at a couple of horizontal lines, especially if they don't change day by day by day, right? If the math behind the line is consistent, and your behavior is consistent, You end up having consistent outcomes, good, bad, or indifferent, they're consistent. You can then make the necessary adjustments. Right? So that's where we fall into the trap, right? Instead of making the necessary adjustments, we throw away the tools and go find different tools. It's not the tools that are the problem, it's how we use them. And I, I needed something mechanical. I, I needed something. That I could not argue with, right? And so this kind of forced discipline. Right? So this was supposed to be a long. It clearly did not go long. And so we made it to the short breakout level. It did bounce. That's an opportunity to sell. Right? And then when we did break. We're now targeting the breakout target. Right? And on the way of doing all of this, we happen to fulfill the average daily range. Right, so these are the things I've been teaching you to do. Without the Camarillo pivots. Right? We are looking at the average daily range as our beginning, you know, top-down analysis, and then we end up on this ladder between the 1 hour and the 5 minute chart drawing levels. These are the levels that we're picking up on. You know, with our mind's eye, we can see yesterday's price action, and we can see levels in the general ballpark. That are good enough. Right? So, I started very mechanically inclined, very, you know, I wanted automation, I wanted everything. Perfect. And I realized there's a lot of Necessary discretion. I see even the robots don't have the necessary discretion. And so this is where I had to adapt the Camarilla pivots to what I'm looking for, right? So the same concept, I just, I, I kind of converted it to a manual approach. Right? So if it gets to a certain level, we would expect it to reach us uh the next step, much like we do with our ladder, right? When we trade the ladder on the 5 minute chart, we tend to go up or down 3 to 4 rungs, and we have an expectation, we kind of know what to do next. This is it, right? We know what to do next, and it's It's undeniable because the math that's behind it, right? So if you follow the structure that's highlighted here, if you follow the trade plan that's highlighted here, it's slightly better than 65% win rate. All right, so for some people, that's enough, for others like me, I need it better than that. Uh, you know, it's, it's, there's nothing wrong with 65% win rate. Trust me, there's nothing wrong with that. But I, I lowered the bar even lower so I could get my win rate even higher. Mhm. Crude oil inventory just came out, nothing to worry about. So yeah, this, this really simple strategy was an eye opener for me because it really highlighted how The day, whether we whether we like it or not. Uh, it's out to get us, right? It's always trying to beat itself, right? It's always to make itself look better, and in doing so, it's taking out the stops. And ultimately, it, it breaks out and reaches a, a mathematical target. Right, so how the day unfolds and what we do with it? It's this, you know, sometimes it starts and it goes straight down. Right, but usually, more often than not, it, you know, it's sideways in Asia, and then it starts to pick up speed in Europe, and then in North America, we find the end of the day. That's exactly what's happening here on this picture, and the way we've been trading it manually. So you guys have any questions so far? There you see, yeah, uh. What am I using to plot this? Yeah. So on MT4, uh, this is the MT4 platform. The tool that I'm using is called Pivot 2. It's something that I've had in my back pocket for, I don't know, how long now. Uh, you can get this from the market, the uh MT4 market. I, I've had this forever. Uh, but yeah, there's a million different sources of Camarilla pivots. They, the formula is a standard, right? There's really just one way of calculating it. So, Camarilla pivots are the same. Some, uh, they'll have the, the lines in the same positions, but some may not have the labels, and most that I've seen are mislabeled. They, they're still using the old nomenclature like R1 S1. Where Camarilla has its own tags. Right, so, if you follow Camarilla, let me remove the history. Actually, let me just change templates. Uh, it's go to a different one, pivots. When we're looking at just there you can see the Camarilla pivots, and you can see traditional pivots. Right, so the traditional pivots, daily are 1, daily R2. Daily are 3. That's based off of yesterday's price action. But from the opening price, they tend to be further away. Then the Camarilla, right? Camarilla is tighter to the actual price action. And so, with a tighter window, more opportunities are presented. Right? So by now, associating a tag, like a, a call to action, there's a job to do every time you get to those levels, whereas traditional pivots don't tell you what to do. So you have to have a plan already figured out, right? When we got to the daily support. The market did bounce. But ultimately, the Camarilla pivot was correct. Right? And then on the way to daily support too. We have the Camarilla target. Right? So it's the latter that we would have built on our 5 minute chart. And ultimately we're going up and down this ladder made up of horizontal lines. Right? And then when we start to look at uh ichimoku on top of this, you're now trying to estimate the trend. Right, so you're, you're, you're not fighting that overwhelming tide. Right, so if it tells you to short, And it's a down trend. Take the short. If it takes you to take the long breakout in a down trend, take the long breakout. Right? So you'll see me sometimes I'm extremely convinced in my position, like I'm, I'm adamant, if I hold on long enough, I'll be correct. A lot of it comes from having survived this. I put myself through this exercise, you know, living through the pivots, the mechanical approach. Right, so mechanizing something, uh, standardizes the output. Right, and that's kind of where I needed to to come in at. I, I wanted to remove the randomness from every angle. And this was one step in that journey. Right from here I went on to trading with Ihimou, and then I combined the two. But this is, this is the key to trading ranges, right? If you have a time window. That pivots can give you a pretty good idea of what's happened up to now, where are you now and where are you heading to? Right, so it defines your environment. We have our ceiling, we have our floor, one has to give way. Right, and in this case this morning, it looks like the ceiling, we bounced off the ceiling. Right, and now we're coming to test the floor. The floor would have been over here. Right, we fulfill the average daily range on the way. We will be bouncing for the wick on the daily candle in the next couple hours. Right? So something here evolved over time, and it followed a pattern that we can kind of anticipate and put a label to. Right, so nothing new is presented, it's just presented differently. Uh, on yeah, on Sea Trader, uh, I'm not sure. I, I. Uh, let's see, where is my Creator platform? Hm, I don't know where my platform is. Oh, there it is. So On Sea Trader, you can find it. I think On on their other. Oh, this is the web version. Yeah, this is Guy trade, sorry. On the web version, I don't think it's available, but on the desktop version you'll find it under other. This only gives you traditional pivots. The R ones and the S ones. Right? And so, but you'll, you can find it online. I've, I've had, I, I, I do have it. I just got to locate it. I don't use them anymore. This is, you know, I've kind of outgrown them, but uh that's part of growing up as a trader, you know, you, uh, you experiment with stuff. This was part of standardizing my approach. This is a really good way for new traders. That require a mechanical approach to uh get introduced to trading. Uh, No, no, you can trade, you can trade trends with pivots. You just, the pivots are good to anticipate where you may want to take an entry in the trend, right? So if you have a trend that pulls back to a pivot, take the take the trade, right? It's, it's just a line in the sand. It's a place for you to make a decision, to make a A call, you know, do I add? Do I remove? Do I do nothing? Do I target, you know, do I get out, right? This is why the structure, the the trade plan tells you where to put your stop, and the pivots themselves tell you how to behave. Right, but in theory, the Camarilla pivots are for day trading, you know, for those of us that plan to be finished within the day, 24 hours, right? So if you trade in Asia, you're range bound, mostly between H3 and L3. If you trade in Europe, you're expecting a break of H4 or L4. And if you trade in North America, you're trying to get to one of those H5 or L5 targets. Right, so it's just The day evolving, right? The day starts at tip 0 and it has to end at 60. And there's a lot of overlap in there, and that overlapping has to go through these pivots, and the pivot kind of tells you. What to do next, right? Like a trampoline almost. Yeah, so as far as the pivots are concerned, there's a lot of, uh, there's a lot of different variations out there. You know, Fibonacci pivots, woody pivots, Denmark pivots, uh, you know, traditional pivots. They all have a purpose. They were all invented for some reason or other. The Camarilla pivot was the only one I've come across that has an actual job attached to the line. Undeniable job. Just do the damn job, right? So if you're looking to mechanize your approach, this is the best way to do it. And it teaches you to take the losses, right? Because it tells you where to put your stock, you know, the, the previous pivot, so to speak. And so if, if you're going backwards to the previous pivot, it's clearly not doing what you thought it would be doing, right? So, uh, Camarilla pivots, definitely, definitely something you want to get yourself into, uh, at least trying once or twice. Uh, once you see it, uh, once you see its benefit. Intraday, you know, how the day is being formed each day starting at 5 p.m. at Pip zero, and somehow we end up covering, you know, 60, 70, 80 pips. Imagine the weekly candle. It starts Monday, Monday night or Monday morning, Sunday night. Right. Piper And then we have Monday, Tuesday, you know, it, it takes time. We do find the high of the week, we do find the low of the week. So we do have a range between Monday and Friday. And we finish usually off of. The H5 or the L5. Weekly pivot, right? The week has to unfold in the same fashion. And then you have monthly pivots that work just the same, right? The month has to start has to start on day one. And there's 20 trading days. Right? But by the end of the month, you've moved like 300 pips. And so the key to all of this is the line in the sand and the job associated with it. Right, and it's just understanding the bigger picture that's at play. Right, in this case, you might be looking to go long. Right. Making higher highs, you had a trick. Lower low right there. Right, that's what you see almost every day. Especially if you trade in Europe. And because I trade in North America, I see this almost every day, right? Today, it so happens to be the flip side. Right, so today we happen to be doing it at the bottom. Right, but it's the same thing. It's Theoretically, uh, consistency. In a camp. You just have to, you know, employ it. You just have to put it to work and kind of use a conviction. You know, stick to it. Don't give up the pivot too early, you know, just do the job. And then when we look at stuff, you know, like the dollar index, you can apply pivots to that too, or you can apply pivots to just about anything that moves. Right? It's a mathematical way of looking at yesterday. It's like breaking up today into pieces and trying to figure out which piece am I in right now, like the upper half, the lower half. Trying to figure out where you're located in the big scheme of things, right? So when we look at the dollar index, our approach to the dollar index is to see it like a counterparty to the euro. But in, in real, you know, in real life, it only occupies maybe 58%, right? It's not the entire counterparty, it's not the US dollar, right? The dollar index is a made up number. Right? And this is the makeup, right? It's made up of 57% euros. So it's not entirely Euros. And so if let's say the Japanese do something, it may impact the euro, right? If the pound moves, which it did overnight, it impacted the euro, right? When the CAD does something, it impacts the euro, right? So all of this impacts each other. And the aggregate of this. Is the dollar index, right? So it's basically Removing the US dollar from the equation. Right, so we're, we're looking at all the counterparties to figure out what is the dollar worth. Right? So if you take 58% euros, 13% yen, 12% pound, 9% CAD, Norwegian krona, and Swiss franc. And you add them up. You'll get a pretty good estimate of what the dollar is worth. Right? So this is where this comes in, and as we speak, the dollar. Approximately on an index basis is 106. Right, 106. So, if it's 106. And 58% of this is Pushing or pulling on the euro. That's more than half, right? It has a lot of weight. To push around, pull, right, so the euro will react. As a counterparty to this. Right? So, in order to kind of gleam as to what this might be up to, We take it one step further, and we look to see what is the US itself, just the US, not the dollar, but the US economy. What, what is the US doing? You look at their yields. You look at their bonds, the bonds pay a yield. Right? So you look at the bond market, you look at the treasury market, which is how they create money. Right, so this is 10 year treasuries. 10 year treasuries, 10-year bonds, 10 year yields. Why the 10 year? Because it's the middle of the pack, right? It's a good, it's a good representation. You can go with 2-year everything, or you could go with 30-year everything. I chose 10. Right? So, I look at this and this, these two kind of are very, very similar to each other. They correlate. They move basically hand in hand. And whatever is happening here. The opposite tends to happen here. Right, so if the bonds are going up, The yields tend to go down. And if the yields are going down, It tends to pull down. What the world values the dollar. Right? So, the aggregate is one way of looking at the price, but this is percentages, and you can't do technical analysis with percentages, right? Technical analysis looks at price. So we do TA, we do technical analysis on price. Right, but we're using this as a really good gauge. Right, so you can do, you know, you can, you can trade or you can Uh, you could create structure here, you could do all sorts of things using this information. Right? But this is, you have to remember this is in percentages, right? It's bound from 1, from 0 to 100, right? The range is bound from 0 to 100. Right, so that's the problem. This is unbound, right? There's no limits to price. And so technical analysis will work with price, but it won't work with percentages. Keep that in the back of your mind, right? So when we're looking at this, we're looking at it as a A clue, right, as to what the euro may be up to, what's the euro going to be attempting if the dollar goes up. And we're looking at this, like, you know, Real technical analysis where you can be looking at it for weeks. I've been tracking this, uh, I started on this chart back here somewhere, and so, but yeah, you know, we're Our expectations are readjusted day by day by day by day by day, and they don't know if you've noticed, but since I've been around, uh, it's everybody against the US dollar. You know, so if you track the US dollar, And you're trading against the US dollar. The clues are here, right? We are at resistance or approaching it, you know, clearly we're almost there. Are we going to get there? If we do, what will happen? Will we break? If we break this, what will happen to our euro? If we break this, the euro will break 105. Right, the euro may end up a parody. You know, 102, 101, 1.000. Right, we have targets. There's resistance up there. Right? We have, we have excuses to see higher, especially if a new wars breaking out. Right? So all sorts of, look at this here, just the fact that we went up, you know, 7% or so. In one month? And the euro just collapsed, right, from October. You can see why. Right? And so by looking at what is happening here, You could get a pretty good idea. Of what the euro is about to do. And the, the push and the pull is not even, right? We saw that on that pie chart. It's 58%, right? So it's, it's not 50/50. The problem will be, we don't know who's pushing and we don't know who's pulling. We don't know who's on the receiving end, right? So sometimes it's the ECB that's making the moves, sometimes it's the dollar that the euro is reacting to, right? So, the problem is trying to figure out the story. And this is where you and I lack, you know, the economics background, the finance background. We, we lack bits and pieces that would make our life a lot easier. Right, but just keeping it as a frame of reference. keeping this as a frame of reference, and understanding what's happening to the dollar in general. It tells you what's happening to the rest of the world, right? I look at the dollar, and then I reference the rest. And then when I look at the yen, I always have ichimou on the yen, because that's how they look at it over there. In North America, the big boys tend to use a 50 and a 200, so I put the same thing on my chart, so I see what they see. Right, we bounced up to 50, bounced up to 50. Right? If we just look at the Europe. No European centric pairs. We're looking at the pound, the euro pound, the Euro Swiss, pound Swiss. USD Swiss Right, and when we're looking at just Asia. You'll notice This is like the Asian session. This would be the European session. And this would be the North American session. Right. Everybody here is paired up against the USD. Everybody here is paired up against the euro. Or the Swiss, and everybody here is paired up against the yen. Right? So, understanding where the US fits. You can do that through the Dixie. And what the precursor or a leading indicator. would be what the yields are doing. Right, so if the yields are going up, It's a good indicator that the dollar will be trying to go up, right? If the yields fail to make a higher high, It's highly likely the dollar will not make a higher high. Right? So that's the kind of stuff we just look at. This is The do focused. Now, this is focusing on you as the only. Or US only, I should say. And this is trying to figure out what the worth of the USD is. By looking at the outside world. OK, so we use this, I use it each day. I don't trade it. I don't place trades on here, but I use it to get like a compass bearing. Right? Sometimes the two move hand in hand, right? Sometimes the euro and the DX. It's rare, but it, it does happen, you know, there's a It's causation is not correlation, correlation is not causation, right? There has to be more to it than that, and we can see it happening in real time. Right, so our problem is really simple. Our problem is trying to figure out The market's next move. Right, and the approach we use, what I've been teaching you guys, uh, price and time cycles. It it gives you a clue as to the potential for that next move, like, where is it? Because everything here from tea time, you know, from T0. It's one little box on top of a box, on top of a box, and then you start stacking boxes, and by the time you're done, the whole day may be, you know, 12 boxes. Right, but you started with nothing, and you had to fill the first box. And then you had to figure out the reversals along the way. Right, but these are measured moves. They're not random unless somebody pushes a button somewhere on fat fingers the market. But that's pretty rare, right? You have a war starting, boom, the market moves a couple 100 pips, but it's not going to the moon. Right? So you may hit your ejection seats, and then you go and figure out what's happening in the real world, you come back and now you trade this. Right, but the ejection seat saved the day, right? So taking losses as part of the game, Camarilla pivots is a good way of learning how to accept them, right, because they're mechanical. And then if you just trust into the system. With this method, with these methods here, you get about a 65% win rate, and that's a good starting point for anybody that wants to trade, right? And again, this is applicable to any time frame, right? You can have Camarilla pivots on the 1 hour, right? You can have Camarilla pivots on the 15 minutes. Just go through the formula, right? I use them on the daily. To see intraday pivots, and I use them on the weekly. To see how the we may unfold, right? Uh, the extremes, uh R5 and L5, right? So, I'll let you guys go. If you have any more questions, you know, send them out in a slack group and we'll, I'll reply to them there. OK. Uh, I, I can post this, this slide in, in the slide group also. I'll, I'll make that public. And then we can all have it. All right? And uh maybe I'll put that into a zip file and we can have the pivot indicator too that for those of you that use the MT4 platform. All right, ladies and gents, enjoy yourselves, trade safe, trade small, and I'll see you tomorrow I guess. Thank you so much. Thank you everybody for joining today, and yep, we'll see everybody tomorrow at the next uh regular session. All right, enjoy. Bye-bye.


## 23 The Consistency Challenge Earning Your Way to Growth aac

Um, all right, so welcome everyone. Um, today is our 5th monthly scalping mastery call. Um, today's topics are gonna be a, a little bit of a year-end review and then the consistency challenge. Now, before we get fully started on that, um, I, just a few administrative things, um, as per usual, please make sure to ask questions, um, use the chat box um for that and make sure it's addressed to everyone, so everyone can actually read the questions as well and that um we don't miss anything that is going directly to Jean-Francois. And other than that, it will be as usual. So Jean Francois, over to you. Already, good morning, good afternoon, good evening, everyone. It is the 18th of December 2024 at 10 o'clock Eastern time. Uh, we're not gonna be trading first thing in the morning. Uh, instead, we're gonna review, uh, some of the work we've done so far as a group, uh, in multiple accounts that I've been running, and we can also touch on how we can transfer some of this. Knowledge, the skills set that we've been acquiring into next year and uh focus on the start of the year with one goal in mind. And so, I don't know if you've ever been told this, but the best compliment you can give another trader in the trade in this trade is, wow, look how consistent this trader is. Right? So the goal of trading is to be really, really good at your craft. The byproduct of being good at your craft, of being consistent at what you do is this unlimited ceiling, right? You can strive to reach for the sky. Nothing is stopping you once you know how to do it, right? And so the idea of consistency is the root of what I do, right? It, it really is the basis for everything that I, I aim to achieve. And over time, that drove me to lower the target, right? This is why we shoot for a one minute bar as our typical exit. Once in a while, we'll engineer something that gives us more or less than 3 lips, right? But consistency is kind of where we're coming in to, you know. Uh, this is what we're coming to work for, right? I'm coming to work every day to be as consistent as I can be. The only issue that I have is this incoming stream of data is never the same, and day by day I'm faced with a new environment. I'm still filtering the information the exact same way. Right? And so why am I doing all of this, you know, and why is this consistency so, so, so important other than just a stroke of the ego? Well, besides, you know, a compliment, it's also a business. And if I can be as consistent as can be. I can more or less have a budget for each one of my clicks. So, for example, I decide to go and buy a new Mercedes next year, I can decide which model, and I can figure out how many clicks it's gonna take me to pay it off. Right, my clicks are the same over and over and over and over. I can budget my clicks. And if I'm running a short term business day by day by day, and I return that financing back to the broker every day, so I'm returning the leverage that I used, I'm not paying for borrowing that money day by day. Once in a while, I may be forced into a hedge to protect what I'm working on from affecting the rest of my business life. Right? So, there is a purpose for having flexibility and discretion, and then there is a purpose for having protection to keep it away from everything else that you have, right? So, the game, the game is to focus up here. And to not let it affect the rest of your life, right? There are times when you do have to Do the uh do what's not nice to do, right? Nobody, I personally don't like hedging. I'm sure there's few people that enjoy hedging. It's just extra complicated, right? So, focus on doing what you know you can do really, really well. Practice this in case you need to do it, right? But consistently aim. At you yourself becoming a better operator, right? We don't want to be changing the targets, we don't want to be changing the stops, we don't wanna be changing time of day. We want to become a better operator, right? Focusing on protection, right? Defense, defense, defense. And then by thinking like this, by employing edging only when necessary. Right, you end up with something like this. So, a little bit of a backstory. We started this course, I think it was late June, early July, and by uh September, August, September, the original broker I was working with uh stopped using Crader. And so I kind of Moved on to a new broker and started a couple of fresh accounts with this new broker. And so what you see here dates from October, so we're missing two months before that, but it, it reflects still, you know, quite well the consistency that we put through, right? So we started this account with 10,000. This is only one of two that I've been running with you guys. So I have DTT1 and DTT2. We'll look at this one in a minute. The other ones I can't share with you, but the same idea, same concept. Uh, net profit, right? So in this account in 2 months, we've created about $2000 worth of net profit, right? We have a positive profit factor. Right, that's the ratio of net profit over net losses. Right, we have an extremely high win rate and a very low drawdown. And the reason why this is critical to us is because this is per trade. And we take our 1%. And we've broken it up into 4, right? So maximum we'll have is maybe 16 clicks or 4%. Each one of those clicks is 0.25%, so each 25%. Was a maximum drawdown about 1%. 0.95, right? So we can see I have running trades in the account right now, so that's a floating equity. Uh, no withdrawals were taken using margin active since October, and so now this is when we start to get into the nitty gritty, right? Where the consistency comes in, right? So since October 1200 trades, you can figure out how many that is per month. Right? Winning trades. Longs and short. And if I go back and look at the daily chart, I'm pretty sure uh we had opportunities pretty much evenly. Right? So the disparity between us, the reason why it's not fifty-fifty could be time of the year, could be seasonality, could be, you know, uh, real life, right? At the same time, me sharing my workload amongst different accounts. May also provide a different uh visibility here, right? You can see in this account, we started the 21 of October. Uh, and the ratio is very, very different. Same kind of, you know, same kind of Gradual slope, a little bit more money. Uh, I think in this one we did more swing trades. OK, same kind of idea though, right? Profit factor is positive, very high, high, high win rate, and we, we turn over our tiny tiny trades many times per day, so we don't carry a lot of drawdown. Right, uh, If we look at the relationship. Seems to be similar, right? We're averaging. On average, Some days are better than others. It used to be, in my personal case, Fridays were the worst. I used to have red Fridays. And every other, every day of the week was green except for Friday. And then I figured out that on Friday, Friday came with a reversal, right? Friday is the end of the week, and more than likely Friday will also have a a pullback, some kind of a reversal that goes against the weekly wick. And that's, that was a big aha moment. And so now I play Friday very defensively. And so long, long story short, right? If we look at all the trades in about 2 months, the consistency comes shining through. Right, we have losing trades on average. We have winning trades on average, and you can see how big that is compared to our average trade. Right, so clearly we were using hedging at some point. And clearly we had a winning side on the hedge and a losing side on the hedge. Right, so you can see how far we're willing to take things. Right, but consistency comes through with, you know, 1200 trades or so, 1314, 1500 trades. After a little while, you can see an average return per trade. This is that budget I was talking about, right? If you want to go buy a new car, you'll know exactly how many clicks. It's gonna take you to pay it off, and better yet, if you separate your systems, so you do 3 5s, 3 5s, 3 5s in one account. And you do your discretionary trading in a different account, like swing trading, so you keep things separate from each other. This budget becomes even more precise, right? This click, this revenue per click becomes even more. Predictable, right? So the consistency is what we're aiming for. This number here is what we're trying to keep as consistent as possible. And then if you can do this through maybe 1 or 2 accounts. Concurrently, so you're you're maybe separating swings from three pips, you're keeping your strategies independent of each other, so you're not borrowing from Peter to pay Paul. You're not, you're not using the wins of one strategy to support a losing strategy. You have to keep them in keep things independent. And at the same time, collecting a little bit of data will also show you, oh, look, on Tuesdays, I don't seem to take losses. Why is this? And then again on Wednesdays, my losses seems to be bigger than every other day. Why is it that Wednesday is my worst day, right? So you go back and look at your journal, look at, you know, was this related to a news event? Was this a one-off, is this something that happens in all my accounts? Right, the reason why I break things up into multiple accounts is because the the ultimate objective for me is about 0.25% per day. And if I can do a 0.25% per day, And I do it in 4 accounts. I just made 1% that day. And so, I don't have to push for 1%. I just have to do my average 0.25%, and I can copy it. I can replicate my efforts without having to, you know, bust a sweat. And so really what I what I and we need to do is understand where our liability is, understand where our problems are. This is why we journal. The bad traits, right? My journal is full of mistakes. I don't document my good days. I write down the total, but I, that's it. I don't write down any of the events, right? The events that are in my journal are made up of these little red boxes. Right? And so in theory, I'm tracking my mistakes, and over time I see patterns. This is where this website comes in, right? So over time, if you connect your platforms to a service like FX Blue or My FXBook, which I saw some of you were already doing, you can collect a lot of important data. Uh this is reflecting a At EA that operates very similar to what we do, right? So this is an EA that I created that trades upside down risk to reward ratio like you and I are doing 3 5s, 35 35s. And what's important to remember is the data, uh, Proves where there's a problem with your system, or proves where consistency is focused, and you can, you yourself, figure out how to work this stuff out, right? Get this stuff out of the system. So when you're trading manually, You have a lot of discretion. Right, and the discretion may be a problem. When you're focusing on the consistency, you have to figure out where your where your strengths are and where your weaknesses are, right? And so when it comes down to analyzing your data, figuring out what you're good at, what you're, what you're, you know, what you're not so good at, you need to see as much of that data as possible, and you need to see it. Over an extended amount of time. There's something like 500 days of data in here. Uh, lots and lots and lots of trades that I put through using these robots, right? The robots proved to me that the strategy was making money. And at the same time, It proved to me that I, I'm not a good robot manager. I don't like managing robots, right? And so, uh, where's I wanted to find, uh, it's under, I think it's under risk. Yeah, so this is what I'm looking for. And so I'm a better trade manager, right? I don't like managing employees. I like managing trades. And so I, I took what I know was working with the robots. I boiled it down to bare bones. I took the best instrument, the cheapest instrument, and I went full force ahead manually. And I'm, you know, averaging something similar to this, doing it manually. Right, so I took what the robot is really, really good at. I boiled it down to what It's best at, and that's what I'm doing manually. I'm ignoring everything else. I'm leaving a lot of money on the table on purpose, right? It's the psychology. I'm, I don't want to be managing robots. I wanna be managing traits. It makes me happier, you know, it, it makes me a lot more. Uh, a lot more consistent over time. Why does your robot show average trade lengths for, yeah, because it only took 1 to 2 trades per day, but it did it across all 27 pairs. Right, and so this is, this is what I'm looking for here, right? So we have our most adverse excursion, and we have our most favorable excursion. And that's where you aim to be consistent, right? There's thousands of trades here all stacked on top of each other. And there's very, very few stragglers, right? Our efforts is focused here, right? We're trying to focus all of our work here. If I don't touch my target, all my trades will be on top of each other, and I will not have stragglers, right? So, the most adverse excursion you have to track, and your most favorable excursion in our world is 3 Peps. Right? So 3 pips, 3 pips, 3 pips, 3 pips, 3 pips, 3 pips. No, no, no, these are not, uh, you're asking if these are outliers. Uh, let's go back. No, this is just the way the system was designed. The system was looking for small, small, small trades, but not 3 pips, right? It, it's making a lot more money than 3 pips, but it's just, there's fewer trades to be gathered, right? So I'm running. The same robot across multiple pairs. In this case, I think it was 17 pairs, yeah, 17 pairs in this account, and Uh, Log out and log in and then in uh. In this account, this one here. I did all 27 pairs, 28 pairs, and that That's where The, the filtering down started, right? So here was about 550 days. The account was making good money, and then in about 9 months or so. The account doubled right there, 100,000. The account doubled. And so that puts in that pink line here and everything keeps going after that. The issue that I had with the robots is at the start of the war with Ukraine. The hedging started to kick in, and so you'll notice the P&L. It's floating PNO. This is the problem with hedging, folks. Right, as soon as the war started, right around here, February. Uh, where was it? Anyway, somewhere around here, where the war started, the hedging just went out of control, and it has not returned since. Right? So this is kind of the idea behind doing it manually and understanding that when you're going into box 5. It's not worth the battle anymore. Right, under certain circumstances, you may want to hedge, but that's not every time. This is where the discretion comes in. This is where the practice comes in. This is where showing up every day is uh is a really, really good. Way of learning this stuff, right? So when we go to look at the stats, Right, it's still a winning system. But I got rid, I have to get rid of the hedge, right? I have to get rid of this hedging thing. This is what drove me back to trading manually. Right? So the consistency of the system works. We have to learn how to lose. Clearly, the machine is not trained to lose. The machine was trained to keep fighting. And the machine kept fighting and fighting and fighting to the point where it put more than half of the money back to work. Right, so that's a problem with with trying to manage risk by avoiding to lose. That was proven by doing this, and that proved this to me. Avoiding losing, using hedging is not a good case. Uh, it, it doesn't provide you what you're looking for. Right? So there's tons and tons and tons and tons and tons of winning trades here. Right, but when there's an outside push on the world, it changes. The machines not programmed to take that into account. OK, so that's, that's why I left the robots behind, right? Not because they're broken or damaged or anything like that. It's because it requires a different kind of management. I'm a trade manager, right? So from a trade management standpoint, I went back to doing what I know best, shooting for a small achievable, repeatable target. Average pips, in this case, 5, because we have some swing trades in here. Right? But it's tiny, it's manageable, it's reputable. We've put in about $11 million worth of throughput in volume. Right? So this system works, right? Once we take this idea of stop, start, stop, start, stop, start, stop, start, trade a little bit and stop, right? Come back and do it again tomorrow. You can flip flop between 234 accounts, right? You don't have to keep risking the same account. If I make a mistake today, it's contained in that account. And I'm not damaging the other stuff that I'm working on, the stuff that it doesn't belong to me, right? So it really is. Segregated, I called it curated, right? We're really focused on one objective and keeping things separate for a purpose. But once, once you have, in this case, 3 months of a track record, 2 months of a track record, you can start to see the value in having an average return, right? An average consistent return maybe per day. Right, so let's look at it this week. I didn't trade this account this week. Yesterday, nothing about the previous month, right? So the previous month, you can see there are swing trades in here. Right, so once you understand what you are capable of, On average, whether you do it through the Ctrader, no reporting, or you do it through MT5 reporting, which you can get similar data, or you connect to FX Blue or MyFX Book. What you, what you want to do with this bit of You know, proof under your belt, you know, proof of what you're capable of. Yes. Yeah, if I alternate on a diff, OK, do you alternate accounts on the daily basis to protect the accounts? Well, kind of yes and no. I have multiple accounts and some of them are not all mine, and so I dedicate 2 hours of my time to each account, and there is a rotation, there is a schedule there. And so typically I have 2 to 3 platforms open. And it's not day by day on the same accounts. OK. Uh, but at the same time, I'm not trying to reach for 1% per day, right? I'm just trying to get to my average and I stop, and that's the same in all the accounts, unless it's a swing trade or in grandma's account, it's a very different thing there, right? So, going back to this consistency thing, uh, That once you know what you're capable of, what you, you have this, you know, I'm good at making 5 pips 5 times each day, or whatever it is, you know, in our case, it's 3 pips about 30 times per day. On average, sometimes it's more, sometimes it's less, right? Starting in January, you might be wise to start tracking this and earn the right to grow, right? Instead of hoping for the best, and instead of doing a a a growth uh schedule haphazardly. You can follow a standard. Uh, you know, a standard pattern, a standard. Uh, model, right? And so by modeling yourself after a consistency challenge, Right, so you're not trying to You're not trying to make a million dollars, you're trying to prove to yourself that way you think you're capable of, you are capable of, because you've already been doing it for a few months now, right? You've already been making a few pips per day, and I've been preaching this, right? Leave the casino. And if you can make a few pips each day and leave the casino. That winning day is yours to keep. You can come back and repeat that effort the next day, right? You don't have to make a 1%. You can make a 25%. Maybe x 4. Right? So it's, it's in the mind, right? What if we take the goal and break it up into tiny, tiny, tiny pieces, it makes it a lot easier to get there. And this spreadsheet kind of proves this, right? Because now we're gonna be exchanging time for money. Instead of putting the cart in front of the horse, We're gonna let the horse do the work. Right? So the spreadsheet will be used to record your progress, right? Not to fantasize about the future. Right? And the plan is to trade a small amount. These are just numbers that I plugged in there because we all have to start with something. And the idea is to use. The right to grow, right? You have to earn that right, the account to something substantial. And then you can take this new substantial amount of money. And produce an income. But people have this backwards, right? 99% of the people that start trading are trying to make an income. And they're doing it with nothing. And therefore they kind of blow up. What we're aiming to do is eventually get there using only consistency. And the powers of compounding, right? That's the 8th wonder of the world. And so typically, because we start very, very, very small, we have very little money, we have to risk most of it, right? It's very difficult to make money if you have nothing at risk. And so if you're starting with $1000 most people will risk on average 1% of it. And they're gonna try to make 1 or 2% from that. And if you have small, small, small money, that makes sense, because it's not something you're trying to sustain. It's not something you will need to do forever. You're not over risking forever. Right, so in the beginning, you're kind of forced to over-risk. But you overwhelm that very quickly, right? So, trading multiple lots the way we do, or multiple small trades, we don't want to have a sum total more than 1%, which is what we are already doing, right? We break it up and we spread it out. And the target is to somewhere near 20 pips daily average. This is just a number that's plugged in there to fill in a blank. Whatever your average is. Right, from back here. Right? Whatever your averages are from back here, right, all history, plug these numbers. In here. Right, and then over time, you will earn the right to grow the account. You will see this in a minute. Right, so the idea. It is to adjust the size according to the schedule, not before. And especially not after, right? You don't want to be playing catch up. If we fall behind one day, if we lose on one day, We try to lose one day of work, right? So that means you have to be really, really good at booking your losses instead of maybe picking a fight. Right, so maybe you need to lose in box number 2. Instead of allowing it to go to box number 4. Right, so think about that. Right? And then lastly, Voluntarily, you can at some various points along the way, choose to keep trading without increasing your size. So you're now making more money with less and less risk. Right, you're risk, you're making the same amount of money, sorry, with less and less risk. And at some point, so that's, this could be, you know, 50 days later. The account will have increased substantially, where the 1%. It's still 1%, but it's not so much of an impact on the account. Right, and this will add time. And substantially reduce the risk. But again, it's voluntary, right? So this is the transition when you're beginning with a small amount of money and you're over-risking a lot of it. Once you get past this threshold where I can now breathe a little easier. That helps you get there. Once you can breathe a little easier, things are kind of settling down, right? You're, you're, you're not having to over-risk anymore. Maybe you're at $2000 now. Maybe you're at $4000 right? So the key is to stop trading every day. I find a way to come out flat. So that means maybe you don't over trade in the first place, right? Maybe that means you only do 4 clicks. You get, you know, your 1214, 15 pips. And you stop. Right. The worksheet is protected, but you can overwrite any of that stuff, right? So when we look at the actual scenario, you know, what we're trying to achieve and how this will work, actually, let's go back here for a sec. Uh, so what we're trying to achieve is this, right? The, the column on the left. The column on the right is next year's challenge, the objective, right? So, this year's challenge, 2025, we want to start in January. We want to go forward for 300 days. Do your average each day. And walk away, go to the beach. You'll clearly see the 1st 100 days show you very little progress. This is when most people quit. This is when most people walk away and say this is BS, right? John doesn't know what he's talking about. I'm here to tell you, if you can survive the 1st 1100 days. 34 months. The rest of it changes. On your behalf, right? You have to put in the initial effort. To watch the mathematic takes over. Right? And then ideally, you can start to project what your worth will be. Right? But you have to start small. You have to start applying consistency. You have to stop every single day, so you get to keep this consistent return, right? So, clearly, projected income is nil in the beginning. Right, but if you earn the right to grow consistently over time, things change. Halfway through the challenge, it's actually worth something. 100 days later, your life has changed forever. Right? And so the problem is we cannot see 100 days into the future, and so we bring it forward. We try to do then, oh, so we try to do now, what we will be doing then. And then we put the cart in front of the horse and everything falls apart. Right, so going back to the spreadsheet. Right, we want to start small. What number you have, plug that in there. This factoring that you see here can be seen as leverage or gearing, right? So if you have mini lots to work with, put 10 in there. If you have micro lots to work with. But 100 in there, right? Clearly it changes the scale of things, right? Clearly it will change the bottom line. Right? And clearly it will change the graphs. Right? Everything changes. But that doesn't stop you from focusing on consistency. It doesn't stop you from adjusting this along the way, right? So you can favorably. You know, the realistic like like Giannis is saying in the chat room, the realistic number because of a $1000 balance, would be to start with 100 gear, 100. If you start with 10,000, bring this down to 10. Right, but the consistency is what we're aiming for, regardless of your balance, right? So, look at the consistent return. If you put in your average each day, in this case, we're plugging in 20, just for the sake of argument. If you do your first, I believe it's 50 days, yes, 50 days, right? So from day one to day 50, your size does not change at all. Until the account has finally grown substantially. Right, now you've earned on day 51, you've earned the right to grow your size. And that stays the same for the next, I believe, 25 days. Right? By then the account has grown a little bit more. Right, so if I go back to 10 over here just to uh There you go, just to simplify. If I go down to day 76. We now increase our size again. We've earned the right, right? So it's speeding up. We're getting better at this, we're not screwing up. We may have a losing day. If you lose a day, you go back. It's not snakes and ladders, right? You don't fall backwards 10 days. You only lose 20, or in our case, 2 boxes. And or you make two boxes, right? You, you do your average or you lose your average. The the 300 day challenge may become 400 days, depending on, you know, how, how bad you are at this, right? But it's not. It's not something that should impede your focus, right? We're not, we're not. We're trying to project what our worth is. We're trying to figure out If our effort is uh is a waste of time, right? Clearly, the mathematics over 1 year, about 60 weeks, proves that it's not a waste of time. Right, so, so let's say here, day 165 or day 150, halfway through the challenge. This is 30 weeks in. You're now trading, if you started with a $1000 account. You're now trading 11,000. It's a 1.1 lots. And if you make your 20 pips with 1.1 lot. Your day is 220 bucks. That's a nice day. Right? And then a couple of weeks later, let's say you're now at day 200. 5 weeks later. You're trading 2.9 lots. With 20 pips. That's a $580 day. Right, so it gives you an idea of what your clicks are worth. And if you can focus just on consistency for this half of the challenge, So, in 2026, January, February of 2026, or maybe March of 2026. You have a very different trading account to work with. And this takes us to the right side. This now allows us. It allows us to restart the year, the next year, the following year with this brand new account, which is Let's go back to 100. Right, so this is a function of the bottom line of the challenge. Whatever you finish the challenge at, you start the new year. Right, so you start the new year and you can start earning a salary, right? And this is where people fail, right? Most people are trying to compound the account and withdraw money at the same time. And you cannot have your cake and eat it too. And so you either grow the account. And then withdraw on a monthly salary. Right, so if you restart the next year with this new bottom line money, And you can restart with that bottom line effort you were doing. So, last day of 2024. You're, you're trading 21 lots for 20 pips, you're making a $4000 a day. If you do this every day. It's an $80,000 a month. It's a million dollars a year. Forthcoming, right? So this is what we're targeting, right? We start the new year with this. Consistency is the key, right? We start the new year. With this new money, we do our 21 lots with 20 5s, that's our $4000 day. You do this every day for the month, you, you withdraw your $86,000 and you do this month after month after month after month. The size never has to change, the target never has to change. Nothing has to change. And consistency, right? So the first year is all about compounding on schedule, not because of greed. And the 2nd year, it's all about earning money, and the account continues to grow. Your size does not have to change ever after. Right, so now there's enough money in the account. That 3 Pips is life changing. Right? And that's kind of the key to this whole consistency thing, right? Why try to hurry things up when you know things are coming your way? Right, we need to be able to withdraw a salary. And still have the account grow. Otherwise, you're back to square one. Every time you take a withdrawal, and that's the prop business, right? That's those proprietary accounts. And the problem is we don't see the difference in real time. We don't see the impact that we have in real time. And when you withdraw money from your trading account or when you lose half of the account, you just have doubled your efforts to make that money back, right? You have to make 100% of that money. Why not just make a handful of coins and stop? And do that 5 days in a row. Right? And so you can do this in both a live and a demo account. Right? You could do it concurrently. It's 20 pips or it's whatever your average is, you are not me. I am not you. I don't trade the same time of day you do. I don't trade the same instrument. I, we could be looking at the exact same market and have very different outcomes. Right, but it doesn't stop you from being consistent. You don't have to copy my efforts, right? And so the growth schedule is pasted here at the back and There's 214. Uh, Oh, why is that broken up like this? How many entries are there here? 307. Yeah, so there's about 299 entries. Right, so from that 300 day schedule, right, those first. 50 days or so, very little to do, right? Very little to do. You're just, you're just focusing on doing your average, right? And you can see from here. And that's what we've done. We focused on average. We stopped, we did our daily business, came back the next day and did it again. We came back and did it again, came back and did it again. The stopping every day allows you to keep moving this curve up. Right? If I push, push, push, push, push, I push into a brick wall. I eventually stumble. I, I eventually get crushed, and that happens every day after lunchtime in New York, and this is why we prefer to be flat before lunchtime in New York. Right, so if you take into account the effort that we put in this, couple hours per day. And what it can translate to on here. Couple hours per day. It's this consistency factor that earns you the right to grow your size. And once your size is starting to grow, Your psychology is now. Uh, I don't want to say excited, but Breathes easier, right? Your, your mind can can reward itself for doing a good job, right? You can actually breathe easy and say, oh, I did it, right? And on the way, on the way. It's keeping your glass half full. There will be days, there are days, there's definitely bad days along the way, and we've experienced this just in the last couple of months, but at the same time, our strategy gives us repair tools. And the intent is to be in, out, before you need to fix something. It's when we over trade, we tend to fix stuff. Right, so in theory, In theory, the consistency is what we aim for. The facts is what we trade. With an eye on not changing too much of our process, right? We're not trying to reinvent anything. We're just trying to be as good as can be with this incoming data, right, this influx of unknown. We're pretty good at filtering the unknown to extract 12,000 PIPs. And this is just in one account. Right? How many of our friends, you know, ask your neighbors, ask your trading buddies in the other trading rooms. How many of them have pulled in 20,000 pips in the last two months? Right, and that's kind of the catch, right? Earn the right to grow so that these 20,000 pips are worth hundreds of thousands of dollars. Right, so the key is not to dwell on the dollars and cents, dwell on moving the account forward ever so slightly every day, one tiny deposit per day. And worry about the compounding, right? Let the compounding do the work, do the heavy lifting. You have earned the right to grow your size. If you can get to 275 days without pulling your hair out and quitting, you'll be trading 13 lots. With a target of 20 pips. And if you've been doing 20 pips for 100 and or for 275 days, you're basically doing it as a knee-jerk reaction. Imagine making $2600 as a knee-jerk reaction. Right? It's because you're learning to behave, you're learning discipline, you're learning to recognize the same time of day every day, you're learning to see what should be here. What you should expect, and you are now reacting to this, or this should not be here, this should not happen. Instead of being a deer in the headlights. Right, so the consistency, whatever number you choose to plug in here, that's your number, not mine, right? Whatever you choose to start with. That's another personal choice. Right, the gearing is reflected here in the back, uh, right here. Right, so if you gear to 1000, you're using nanolots. And that might be useful if you're trading with Rwanda. Right, and you're, you're using units. Right? So there there's a million, a million ways of skinning this cat, right? And we just have to agree to uh You know, doing our own thing without having to be Ego driven about it, you know, I, I, it's hard to shake off the idea that I can, I can be happy at 25. When I have all this time in front of me, why not, I, why not just keep going? We saw that just the other day, right? We recycled, I think it was last Thursday. We recycled our way into profit in 35 minutes we were done our trading session. And then because I had an hour and a half to fill, I over-traded an hour and a half longer than my average needed it to be. And I painted myself into a corner. Right? And that's the thing, we, we don't know the future, but as quickly as you can get to getting the job done, get out. Right, so the consistency. The best compliment you can give someone. It it comes down to the basics. It doesn't have to be an unrealistic goal. And if you do have these unrealistic goals, break them down into smaller pieces. Right, that's all we're learning to do here. We're learning to use discipline to stop trading. That forces you to keep your profits. Right? So if you start and you have a bad day right out of the gate. Stop at 2 boxes. Right, don't allow yourself. To lose more than an average day of pay, right? So, consider this a day of pay, 20 bucks, right? Day one very, very depressing. Right, but on the last day, a year from now. That's a nice payday. Right. And depending on which instrument you work on, or work with, this 20 might be an easier target than you imagined. Right, if you're trading yen pairs, uh, they move a lot more than the euro. Right, you might be getting to your target in just a few minutes each day, and earning the right to grow the following day, right? Don't let the today you screw up the tomorrow you. By over trading. Right? If you decide to go flat each day after you've won 20 pips, the tomorrow you will thank you for it. Because you don't have to fix a mistake, you don't have to fix anything. Right, so in reality, you have so much ability here, now that you know how to pull money out of the market. Right, 3 peps, 3 peps, 3 peps and stop. If you choose to shoot for more than 3 pips, shoot for boxes, 1 box, 2 boxes, 3 boxes, right? Because you're giving it 1 to 2 boxes to 3 or maybe 4 of risk. So it becomes a 1 to 1 trade, right? So that takes me back to this over here. All right, so because we're focusing our little hoo hoo train that could on making 3 pips, 3 pips, 3 peps, we are opportunists at heart. And so if I'm busy making my 3 pips, 3 5s, 3 pips, but I can see the potential, I can see what the market is trying to do. Maybe there's a pivot up there, maybe there's a reason to go there. I can make my 3 pips, 3 pips, 3 pips, and leave 1 or 2 trades open. No targets. Only the stop loss, right? Open-ended trade. Maybe an hour or so later, I'm still making 3 pips, 3 pips, 3 pips, but now I'm leaving a second trade open. Maybe at the end of my trading session, when I'm closing the last remaining 3 ip trades. I'm, I may be also closing all of my swing trades together. And so this is contained within 1 to 2 hours. Right? If you have swings that go beyond your trading normal trading session, that's the stuff that you have to manage. Right, the swings have to be managed. Right? They, they have the ability to come back and bite you 4 boxes later. OK, so keeping things separate, different buckets for your different strategies, right? You want to keep things separate, like different financing, so swing trades impact my swap fees, impact the financing for the leverage that I'm using. Right, that's swap. If I can be trading 3 pips, 3 pips, 3 pips and turn the account or the inventory, make a little bit of money each day and do it for free. Haha. Right? And then supplement this with swing trades intraday. Right, as much as possible, and this is how you end up with a little bit more than 3 pips. Per click, right? So it's like gravy on top, right? So we end up with a little bit more than our average, right? 172, 161, 196. And if we look at the actual trade. History. The average trade is $1.25 dollars, $1 30s. OK, so the swing trades do complement what we do, right? They do help actually quite a bit, and they're not necessary, that's the beauty, right? It's not our main objective, right? Our main objective is to have wins each day. Under our control. Stop start, and the losses are the few traits that don't make us 3 pips that have to be managed. In aggregate as a whole. Right? So these losers are usually made up of a break-even trade. I had equivalent winners on the opposite side. Right? So, we have to respect this. We have to understand, on certain days, if we have a big bump of problems, go back and figure out why that particular day, why that particular event. And try and narrow that as much as possible, right? You want to filter that from happening again. And then overall, that spreadsheet is made up of you and your own effort. What you've been capable of. Proven to you. Right, so it's not make-belief, it's your own effort. Forecasted into the future. The same way we use price and time cycle to forecast what the market should land in an hour from now. We can see our own effort and where they should land in a year from now. If you don't change your behavior, or if you change your behavior in the right way. Right, so, um, Typically, if you extend the statistic, if you extend the the sample size, it does come out closer to fifty-fifty. Uh, this year in particular was kind of strange because most of our efforts came in at the end of the year. Right, if we go to the daily here. So we were sideways for most of the year, and then September we went up, October and November we went down. And so if we look at where we are now, right, right back to 2023. Right? We're lower than the opening of 2024. OK, so it's a red yearly candle, and today's big deciding factor, right? Today is the last FOMC of the year. It starts us off for the new year. We're either going to break out of this and look to go to maybe 3:30 on this previous low. Or we're breaking at the top, and we're gonna maybe revisit 6:30. Uh right around here. Right, so today will be the deciding factor where it takes us. We'll see, and you have to remember it's year end, there's only about 8 days left of trading, and so all of what's forthcoming is window dressing, right? Can be trusted. And it's the people that have some catching up to do, right? The S&P is up 30% on the year and some money managers are not keeping up. And so they have to, you know, Uh, they have to look good, otherwise they're going to face redemptions, uh, going into next year. So don't trust what's coming up over the next week or so, right? Wait for today to take us down here or take us up here, and then we'll know what we're up against going into January, OK? For the next few days. Don't trust what you see, right? Nobody is relying on the fundamentals for the next 8 days, right? It's all about Putting lipstick on the pig, right, trying to look good and so be cautious. Uh, very, very few big, big, big players. Over the next week or so, right? So illiquid markets, and today is the biggest player making an announcement. Right, so I would not be surprised if we moved like 150 pips or something, way more than we would normally do. OK, so be cautious, uh, walk on eggshells, and I'll see you Tuesday or tomorrow, Thursday. Right, I hope today was valuable. If you want some of these slides and this content and stuff, let me know and uh I'll put it in the Slack group. OK. Enjoy yourselves, ladies and gents. Thank you everybody. Thank you, Jean Francois will see everyone tomorrow. Yeah, right, focus on consistency. Everything we do, everything we do. It's, it's the key to our freedom. It, that was the hardest lesson for me to learn, folks, so please take it from me, save yourselves, years. See you guys tomorrow. Bye bye. Bye.


## 19 2024 August - Hedging  Trading Other Assets aac

Yeah, I'll start there. Awesome, cool. Uh so I'm just gonna let people come in. I'll just mute everyone, so you might maybe you have to unmute yourself to talk after.

And I think one is coming in, we have another one here, Sam. OK, yes, so let me just minimize all of that. There we go. Yeah the reporting to the recording will work, and yeah, you can, you can go ahead. Perfect. So, uh, it's 2 minutes after the hour on the 14th of August. We're gonna be talking about hedging, uh, how to apply this box methodology to Different instruments, and we'll finish the hour by addressing some of the top down uh questions and issues that uh you may have run into so far, and you know, how maybe we can use top down uh on other time frames and in other environments. OK, so first and foremost, uh, We want to talk about hedging, uh, the why, the why nots, and, you know, hows and how nots. Uh, first document I posted before in our Slack group is something similar to this, uh, the wording may have changed a little bit, but the gist of it remains the same. I'm just gonna move this off to the side, uh, so that it doesn't interfere with what I'm. Trying to show you on the chart, and we can talk our way through this, uh. At the same time, OK? So, in order to practice this idea of edging, uh, you have to understand that it's basically running two books concurrently, right? So if you're currently trading right now in one direction, that's one book. And in that one book, you're tracking, for example, your logs, you know, your entry, your stop loss, your take profit, so on and so forth, right? So you're you're accounting in one set of documents for one situation, and all of a sudden you find yourself in a pickle and instead of, you know, booking the drawdown as a loss. You see the potential for recovery, maybe in 20 minutes from now or 10 minutes from now. This is just a flash in the pan event. You have the suspicion you can survive it. So now you think, oh, what if I just take advantage of this flash in the pan moment temporarily? While I'm on hold for these other traits for my first book, right? So you put the first book on hold, literally by Hedging using a 2nd book. So now you open a 2nd book and you now have a 2nd set of traits. You're still responsible for the first set of trades. Now side by side, they may not uh be for the same purpose, right? So you may have taken the longs original the original trades for a specific reason in mind, you know, thinking maybe 3 pips, 3 pips or 9 pips, 9 pips or 18 or 27, and instead you ended up into drawdown, something happened, a news event, some sort of outside risk, and now you're shorting. The same amount. You're hedged, right? You had 5 longs, you now have 5 longs and 5 shorts. Let's just happened. Well, we've basically doubled our risk if we don't remove the stock losses from the existing trades. So that's requirement number one. Right, your existing trades already had a stop loss. If that stop loss stays there when you open the hedge. You're now doubling on that existing risk. Right, so in order to not do that, you remove the stop and you open the opposite trades. Step number one. So in our case of this practice session, Imagine yourself in a demo account, which this is a demo. Imagine yourself having 5 buys already open. And now for whatever ungodly reason, you have to open 5 cells. Right? In real life, there's usually drawdown between the 5 longs and the 5 shorts. Right, in this case of the practice experiment we're about to take. Pardon, there is no drawdown between the buys and the South. This is just to simplify. The explanation. OK, so in the case of our practice session, we're gonna take 5 buys, 5 longs, without care for stops and and take profits. We just want 10 open trades on the books, right? So I'm gonna go to Uh, quick, quick button panel here and just go sell, sell, sell, sell, sell. And then bye bye, bye, bye bye. OK, so clearly the price moves while I was doing this. Let's double check to make sure I have everything. 1234512345. OK, so I have 5 buys, 5 sells, I don't have take profit, I don't have stock losses. I've simulated a hedge situation without any drawdown, right? So I don't have any drawdown between my longs and my shorts. Let's go back to the document. Step #2. Let the market go. So, in real life. You have your original longs, you're now adding shorts to the mix, you have the drawdown between the two, and the market continues to do its thing. The market continues to move. Step number 3. A little bit into this, each time you feel compelled that, oh, I should be buying this structure, or I should be selling this structure, When you're compelled to keep on trading. Flows the opposite trade instead. Right, so instead of adding more to this, start removing from what's already here. OK, so instead of adding and adding and adding and adding, we start peeling off the existing risk, and the odds are You're going to be peeling off. From the 1st 5 trades that you had, right? So our example was 5 longs, and then we edged with 5 shorts. Step number 3 will have you removing some of those longs as the market continues to drop. Right, so step number 3 basically has you taking away the risk once you're in the hedge. OK, so now you've locked in that drawdown between the longs and the shorts, you've locked that in. The market decides to move in one direction or the other, it doesn't matter because you're starting from zero. And as the market chooses the direction, you can remove from the risk that's already at work. OK, so taking us into step number 4, this being compelled to keep trading, well, this is it. Right, if you see that favorite setup, if you see, you know, support, if you see resistance, if you see a chance of making 3 pips, a very high probability trade, take it. Right, so you're hedged. But you continue to trade. Right, so for example, we have 5 and 5. If I remove one of the longs, which I should be doing. If I remove one of my lungs, or actually it's just close the document or minimize the document. Let's remove one of these, and all of a sudden you can see my drawdown has shifted to the wind side of things. Right? Because I'm removing some of my losing lungs. Right, I'll take another one off, and I just increased, right? I'm transferring from drawdown from the drawdown column into the booking profits column. By booking a loss. How weird is that? Right? By taking it from the drawdown and booking it as a loss on the long side of the book. I creating a winning outcome. If it falls another candle, I'll remove another long trait. I'll book another loser. What am I left with? I'm left with winning shorts. Right? So situationally, it doesn't matter what the next bar is. Because I'm already in on both sides, I can always Change the balance, I can change the offset. Think of it as a teeter totter or a seesaw. And by choosing which one of these I'm closing, I could be booking profits or booking a loss. The idea behind hedging is to be booking losses over and over and over and over. This is how you come out of the hedge, right? If I keep booking my losers. I'll only be left with my winners. Right? Isn't that what this says? Step number 5. Eventually, you will have cleared all of the losing buys or all of the losing selves. And you will be left with only your winning traits, the side that remains winning. Right, so this will typically get you back to break even, and then if you incorporate the step number 4 here, if you continue to trade, maybe with a 36 pip stop, because it has to have a stop loss, it has to have a target. Right, there should be 360. Right, so if I take another trade there. All of a sudden, this trade is outside of the hedge business that we're in. It's, it's its own thing. I can continue to remove a loser. Right, and if it drops another bar, I'll remove the last loser, and all of a sudden, look at that. We're left with only winning trades. We have booked all of our losses off the chart. And we can close everything into profit, including our one. Excess trade. If we let that one be, it should go to target. Right, so at this point, you can start removing. Everything. And we've just made money. Right, so we started with 10 absolutely random trades. And if we go and just look for today. If we just look at today, we've made money. We came out of the game with almost $1. $1.40. Right from total randomness. I just picked 10 trades at random. And we exited Letting the market be the market, just the market was doing its own thing, and all I did is close losers. Which is the most difficult thing to do when we're trading. This is one of the reasons why hedging is in our toolbox, and we just kind of leave it there. We don't like to use hedging. It's not a security blanket, it's barely a band-aid big enough for the wound that you just. And you know, did to yourself. This idea of forcing hedge is bad. You know, if you're going to be hedged, it has to be part of the process from step number one. It has to be somewhere in your process, but it's accounted for from the very beginning. It's not something that you throw on as a last resort because now you find yourself in a pickle. Right, that's the problem with hedging. We think it's a simple way out when in reality. Uh, you just created a big mess with one can of worms. Now opening a second can of worms does not make things better, right? You're just trying to wrangle worms. It's double the risk, double the trouble, double the cost, not necessarily worth it all the time, right? So it's in the toolbox and there's very limited opportunities to use hedging. OK, so that's hedging in a nutshell, uh, that document is posted in Slack, you can go and get it there or you can take a snapshot of this. Right? If you practice this for yourself, do it in the demo account. Uh, if you don't have access to a demo account, go to, uh, I think it's FX Blue. If you go to FXBlue.com and you go up to where it says challenges there. And you, you can open free demo accounts, uh, and you can basically run your way through this experiment on your own. Right, you, you want to start by writing down the equity you have at the beginning. And then go through this exercise and take a note of how well you did, you know, on the way out. Odds are you will finish with a little bit of practice by making money at this. OK, but you have to learn to lose, right? First and foremost, you have to lose in one direction. Before you force yourself to be a loser in both directions at once. And that's Professional losing, losing at a professional level. Right, that's all we do here, is booking losses. And you interfere with that process by taking high probability traits, by continuing to trade. Right, but it's all about booking the losses. Step number 3. That's the part that evades everyone, OK? So, we'll leave it that, we'll leave it at that, and then, uh, you know, if you have questions. Post them in Slack or ask me ask them here, we'll we'll address that. OK, so, uh, as far as trading this box methodology on Different instruments. There's a few ways of approaching that, know from uh what we've already recorded and Uh, put inkjabi and stuff. You can see yourself measuring swings, you can see yourself, uh, accounting for, you know, breathe your moves one way or another. I choose to do that manually, uh, some people, they have a tough time figuring out what swings are, and so, uh, it's, it's OK, there's nothing wrong with that. Sometimes it's not clearly highlighted, you know, so if you can. Go to your trading platform, throw on the zigzag or zigzag color, whichever one you want. Right, you do this on a 5 minute chart, and you could do so, let's say on the S&P 500. Right, uh, sorry, I don't have my ninja trader platform on this laptop, and so we'll look at trading at looking at the CFDs, but it's, it's the same thing. So let's say the NASDAQ, right? So I have my NASDAQ chart here, I'll put zigzag on here. And I go down to a 5 minute trip. Right, so there's the 5 minute zigzag for the NASAQ. If you zoom out a little bit. Yeah, out a little bit. And then take note of these swings, right? So with your ruler, you have to, you know, measure this swing right here, this red swing. 30 points, 7 bars. These are 7. 7 times 5 minutes, right? So that's 35 minutes right there. This swing right there was. 58 points and 30 bars, right? 35 minute bars, so on and so forth, just like any other instrument, we want to measure a dozen or so of these swings and average them to one another. Right, that will give you an average box, just like I do with the euro. And now the problem will be How much money do you spend in that box? I, how much money are you willing to lose? And uh how many boxes do you think this thing is gonna use on average, right? So go zoom out and see what the biggest moves are, right? Just take it with your mind's eye, take a look at these big, big standalone moves, right? The ones that just stick out. And figure out how can I survive this? How many boxes is that made up of, you know, is this 6 boxes where the average is only 3? That kind of psychology, right? You'll soon find out that what you end up doing when you're trading the box. is you are trading an average move, which happens to stack up. To these bigger swings, right? So let me grab my drawing tool here. Right, so let's say this move right here. was followed by this little move right here. Same starting point. was followed by This little move right there. Same starting point. It was followed by Uh, 123, this one. Same starting point. It was followed by This one? Same starting point. You see a big difference here? Right? If there's data on the left, there's something there for us to measure. And there's something there for us to average. If you take all of these swings and you average them to each other, you're gonna end up with a box of some kind. Right, so that's one way of doing it, you know. If you do this idea, if you do this method, try and do it inside of your 2 hour window. Right, so you do today's window and compare it with yesterday, and compare it with the day before and the day before and the day before. You typically won't be trading this box methodology at the open of the market, or in that last hour of the day. That's usually when you'll see these bigger moves, right? You would tend to see these types of events at the open. In that last hour of the day, we want nothing to do with that. We are not trend traders. We're trying to figure out what is an average move. And then exploit this average move kind of over and over and over and over. Right, so an average move from back here. I used You know, multiple times. Maybe it's happening here. OK. Let's go to right now. Oh, then look at that. Right, so that's just one method of finding an average for the, you know, different instruments. We've already highlighted in previous videos that you want to measure a dozen or so of these, you wanna average both the price and the time cycles. And that will yield a box of, you know, whatever dimension. And that is from the actual market, right? So we don't We tend to not pick a fight with the facts. We just trade them as they are. Right, just trade the facts as they are, and in reality, what you'll end up doing. Is trading the price and the time cycle. That the market told you. It was doing on average. Right, so the other alternative to this, you know, uh, price and time cycling. Uh, you want to look at maybe using Bollinger bands, which everyone should have access to on their trading platform. Right, so if you have Bollinger bands. You want to put them on. Uh You want to put them on price? 5 minute chart is plenty. Right, if you've if you've done this box business already on your favorite instrument, and you already have a pretty good idea of what the number of bars is, like for me on the euro, my box is 12 5 minute bars. I would put 12 in here. Right? If you don't know what the number is, start with the default. Right just leave the default 20 Bollinger or 20 day or 20 hours, 20 minutes, just leave the default in there. And then take that same number. And put it in where it says shift. Right, so now you'll have 20 periods, and you want to shift your Bollinger bands. By 2 periods. And we're still going to be looking for swings that are two standard deviations. So now we're trying to look left, 20 bars. For swings that are two standard deviations. And whatever band that gives us, we're gonna shift this to the right. By 20 bars. OK. Look where my box is. Zoom into that. Right, the box is the edges of the Bollinger band. Now, if you really want to get picky with this, You would take this right here. And adjustice right there. Right there. This is one portion. Of what could happen, you know, how we gauge probabilities. So this is a quarter of our probability assessment. Right, so what's left to do is to take this and maybe put one here. Maybe put one here. And maybe put one there. And now The market will tell you what it chooses to do next, but the probabilities tell us that the market is very likely going to be contained to this space right here. Right? It's by looking to the left and projecting what we see here, what the Ranges. To the right, right? So we're looking at the range on the left and projecting that range onto the right. In that box, this distance between the price. And that shift That's 20 bars. That's all far back we're looking for information. Right, so once you have Once you've done that swing analysis, once you've measured that dozen swings or so. Plug that into here, into your Bollinger band. And shift it by that same number. So if I go back to my euro. And I do the Bollinger band here. And I put 12 because my box is 12 5 minute bars. And I push it To the right 12 bars. And I can look at this on a 5 minute scale. And this right there. Should be The box that we use every day. Oops from Here to there. Oops, let me grab it. There we go. Right, so this is 12 bars across. 2 bars across, and it's just slightly bigger than our 9 pips. It's a buck and a half. Right, and that's using Bollinger bands, which are fluid or dynamic. Right, so this is just a representation of what's the last 12 bars giving us. Pushed into the future. Right, so now understanding this, the edges, see here, uh. This right there, this space right here. Take that space, bring it back to right now. And that's your box. Right, that's the potential that the market has, PA. DAY potential average yields. Uh, the crude numbers just came out. Right, so we're looking at potential average yield. And it's in this case, dynamic, it's fluid. Right, it's moving, it's changing along with the volatility of the market. I chose. To figure out what is a constant. And then extract that constant all the time, right? So this was just an alternative to measuring twin swing to measuring 12 swings. For days and days and days and days. Once I did this experiment, this allowed me to confirm what I thought was happening. So something like this here, the price traveled across our box. Right. Same thing here, traveled across our box, actually quicker than normal, so that's probably 2 boxes. Right, 2 boxes on top of each other. Come Right there. Right, so from this swing low, we had a break from that break we pushed another box and came off. In this box we created from the Bullinger back. We use the Bollinger band to determine this. Right, so there's a million ways of analyzing the past. What we have to do is standardize a specific way of Gathering this information so that we can yield potential average from that information, right? Potential and that potential, we pull it out by lowering the bar, 3 5s, 3 5s, 3 pips instead of shooting for the best, no, the one moonshot. We don't want that, right? Just because we don't know the future. For all we know, it it has that potential. But does it have the willingness? Does it have the hump? Does it have the steam behind it to make it? Do this, right? That's the kind of been, that's the kind of question we ask ourselves over and over and over. If you go back to, you know, the S&P and put a 5 minute chart on here, put Bollinger bands on here, uh. On the S&P. Uh, on a 5 minute chart, 12 is actually a pretty good number. And now our box. Starts from here to here. And if you want to see that. Assessment You can go like this. And then again and then again. And so the probabilities tell us that price is highly likely going to stay in this environment. Right? So what comes off of this, that the next step is how do I make money, right? So if I understand the range and its limits, you can plan ahead. I typically would use pending orders. And maybe put a pending order at the top of the box, right? Just in case we visit there, I wanna sell this. In this lower high, lower low environment. Right, so, uh, the potential is there. There's always data on the left, therefore, there's always the probability. That we cover some of that same ground. Right? It's how long does it take? I've proven that in some of the other videos, right? 3 pips can take us 27 hours to make. Right? It, it's, it doesn't make it impossible, it's just strenuous. Is it worth 27 hours to make 3 pips? No, the answer to that is clearly no. Right, but the probabilities tell us it's doable, and it happens over and over and over and over. Right, so I'd be curious to leave this here, maybe on a one minute chart, and then zoom out of this, or zoom into this. Really, there, this is what I want right there. OK, and now let's see how it behaves over the next little the next few minutes. Let's make it nice and tight. There we go. Let's see how the price will behave in that in that next little while. That's about 2 hours' worth of time. Right? So, ideally what you're trying to do is avoid Uh, extreme volatility, right? We are not trend traders, we don't want to get caught with our pants down. Yesterday was a good example of that. Right? Yesterday we were shorting in front of this oncoming steamroller. And we finished our training session just in time before that big. You know, uh, push higher came in. And that's typically, you know, the reason why we plan for that next move instead of chasing the current move, and we made clear of that yesterday, right? We made that clear. We uh we also understood yesterday that the bias was bullish. And we were taking a higher risk by trading counter trend in front of that oncoming steamroller, right? So here, when we're trading things like the S&P or the NASDAQ, oh here's our boxes on the NASDAQ. Still playing within. Are still playing within. It's pushed us off to the side somewhere. There we go, come on. Right, so we'll keep an eye as we keep talking and see how this How this finishes. Right, so, going back to this volatility business. When, like, for example, when the VIX is higher than 1415, this box business will give you grief, right? Just I'm putting it out there, right? It's not a solution to all trading. This is range trading. And when things are not ranging, you're gonna get decimated. Right, so, uh, Appreciate the fact that this system is extremely high probability of success under the right circumstances. Right, so you don't put summer slicks when you try to drive in the winter. It's the same thing here, right? I pick and choose my battles, uh. We have to understand what we're up against, and in the case of futures, the money that you put in the box. is a function of your stop. And in futures, my stop is usually 80 ticks. And my target is somewhere around 40 ticks. So instead of trading in the neighborhood of, you know, 10 to 1 upside down, I'm really closer to 2 to 1 upside down. And instead of putting 16 clicks overall, I only put 2 clicks. Within 2 boxes, so I'm limiting myself to 4 clicks. And when I do this with Ninja Trader. My top down starts on the 5 minutes, not the daily. My intermediate is a one minute chart. And my trading time frame is a 15 seconds chart. And so it's the same methodology, right? There's business to measure on the left, there's boxes on the left, therefore there's boxes on the right. The money that you exploit or the money that you're willing to put to work. Uh, has to be Uh Sized for you, not for me, right? This is why I don't trade futures at the open. I don't trade futures at the close. I trade typically futures when it's aftermarket before my bedtime. Right, so it's really quiet and it's really sideways, it's really monotone, it's really boring, it's almost predictable, stuff like this. Right, I avoid on purpose stuff like this. If you, if you have the ability to trade CFDs. Practice this box business on the CFD instead of going directly to futures first, even if you have to go to that, you know, FX blue. And create a free demo account and practice the NASDAQ CFD. Right, all that will give you is a a a feel for how the Nas moves. You still have to trade if you're in North America by by the North American regulations. Right, so, uh, but get a feel for it, because in reality, the only true difference. Between what you see here as a CFD and what you would see on a 5 minute chart on your ninja trader platform. The scale is about 3 standard deviations off. Right, so when I look at my Euro USD CFD, And I compare the price of the Euro CFD to the 6E futures contract, the price is usually 3 standard deviations off. Right, so it's the exact same chart. It looks identical. But the Y axis is displaced by 3 standard deviations. Somebody has to make their money somewhere. OK, so there's a difference between the futures and the spot market, but it's the exact same chart, exact same behavior, candle for candle. Right, so if there's a box, there's a there's a way of managing that risk. The risk itself has to be sized. For the account. And what you're willing to do with it. Right. So, notice that we've maintained our box right here. The Bollinger band keeps moving forward, but the box stays put. Right, the price keeps moving forward, the Bollinger ban keeps. You know, banding The box is staying put, the price is. Kind of contained to this box. OK. So this is the this is kind of what will happen uh over time. We have to see the proof to believe it. We have to uh exercise. Uh, I don't want to use trial and error. It's, it's, it's reverse engineered, right? We're looking at the real facts. Pushed into the future somehow, or shifted into the future, but these are the facts of the past, right? 20 bars ago, the bands were this wide. We just suspect that in 20 bars from now, The price will have respected that range, right? It's just a probability. The anything can happen, you know. Uh, something disastrous could come about on the geopolitical scale, and all of a sudden the euro is trading at 120. Right? Anything can happen at any moment. All we're trying to do is assess what just happened. To see if we can replicate that again and again and again and again until it stops. Yeah, you want to just clarify a little bit we had a question to chat about uh from Chris about uh the box you're using represents basically twocent deviation. So would it be the whole bong band or is it only half of it? Like only 1 in a deviation. Yeah, so the settings, we don't touch this the Bollinger band settings, uh, except for the shift, right? So the standard deviation stays put. I just put in the time cycle. That I've calculated manually. Uh, if you do this exercise with the S&P or the NASDAQ, measure the time cycle, figure out what the average time cycle is for your window of opportunity. Put that number of bars in here, the number of bars it takes to cycle, and shift the bands by the same number. Right, so if you're going to do this for the sake of argument, uh, go back to, you know, back here. Measure a dozen or so of these swings. Average, then basically you need to create two columns, one column for the number of bars, one column for the number of uh points or pips. That the market has moved, right, let's go back to the white board. I'll be able to show it to you. And then basically with the Bollinger band example, we just need one of those two numbers, right? So what we're doing in real life, what I've taught you guys to do already, is to measure the past, you know, measure these swings. And then average, if this swing right there. With 25 pips, and it took 4 blue bars. That's 25 pips and 4 blue bars, and it was preceded by this move, which was 50 pips and 6 bars, and so we have 50 and 6. And this one and this one. So by the time you do this for a dozen or so swings. You want to have this dozen. Measurements, you divide by 12. And it will give you whatever number. That number is what you want to put in the Bollinger band. And shift the Bollinger band by that same number. And so now what you'll have is this box, but it's dynamic. Sometimes it's big, sometimes it's small. Right, but it will reflect the past. What I've chosen to do is standardize this. Right, so I realized that this number does not need to be fluid. I don't have to have a Bollinger band, I can use a box. Right? So I standardize both sides. So it's like shifting the Bollinger band, uh. And and expecting it to not change in the future. Right? The price basically makes up or or fulfills or Fills less of the box. Right, so in theory, what you're trying to figure out is this range right there, right? If this is a range. You're trying to figure out the width of that range. And you're trying to move that box along as the market is moving. Right? The range is not changing. The range is not changing. Maybe it's its direction that eventually changes, and now that same box is helping you. To go down. Right? But it's the number of boxes that you're tracking, the content of the box is never the same. It's never presented the same way. Right, so what you'll end up doing is it sorry, it only takes A a few weeks of doing this to soon figure out that Most of your data is contained right there. And if you're a swing trader type of guy, you're spending a lot of time waiting for something to hopefully come here, but may very well end up down here instead. So why not focus your efforts where the probabilities are the highest. instead of where the probabilities are at the lowest. Right, so I, I choose to put most of my effort where the likelihood is 99%. Right. In the end, by picking a specific time frame, whether it's 15 seconds on the NASDAQ, or 1 minute on the euro, or a daily chart on bonds. What you end up doing is this top-down analysis before you even click your mouse. And that top down analysis is a way of aligning multiple likelihoods to kind of add confirmation to your trains of thought, right? So if you think of the daily chart as being the entry level chart for the guy that has billions of dollars, right? If you have 12 zeros in your account. You're not gonna be trading on the one minute chart. Right? You need way more confirmation and you have a lot of time on your hands. You have a lot of money to spend or spread, and you're trying to do it without moving the market against your own benefits, right? So you don't want to shoot yourself in the foot. So the guy with 12 zeros. The guy with the biggest account, he's not looking intraday. Let's just leave it at that, right? He's looking his smallest time frame because he's a long-term trader. His slowest smallest time frame is the daily chart, and it's only on the day that it's at a specific level that he may have been waiting for for months. And so on that specific day at that level, he may choose to take a trade by comparing today with yesterday. Is it making a higher high at my level? Is it making a lower low at my level? So right here, that green line, he's comparing today, is it worth is it worth a trade compared to yesterday? That behavior puts to work billions of dollars. That moves the market. You and I don't even fit anywhere near. That that environment, right? So we have to see what they're doing, take that into account. It's a piece of the information gathering process that we go through. And as we gather the information, first off, we look at the bigger player. And then what I've been doing, what I've been showing you guys to do is to look intraday, look at a different group of traders. Right, so now you have the biggest guys, they only care for the one candle, because it's finally at the level that they've been waiting for. And then at that same moment in time, Intraday traders like you and I and people with a few more zeros than us. May take advantage of that same level for a very different purpose. It's more of a uh opportunistic behavior. Right, so at that exact same level. We may see something. That is opposite to what the daily guy, the daily trade. The daily chart trader is looking for, right? At that very same instant, we may be thinking it's time to short. And if that's what we perceive is happening, we will be shorting it with an even smaller time frame. That's our ladder, that's our boxes, right? So when you look at this from the bottom up, Over here, what we've done, what I've been teaching you guys to do is to find out what is an average swing, so maybe this is an average swing. And that one little piece of information allows you to build all of this. Right? It's like the smallest of the Lego bricks to build the biggest Lego structure that you can. Right, it's understanding the structure itself. What is it am I trying to build? Am I trying to build higher highs, or am I trying to build lower lows? And we're riding cold tails. And so we do the top down and not the bottom up. If you know this piece here, you can start stacking it multiple times, unstacking it multiple times, back and forth, back and forth. Take note of what's happening, and you'll soon find out these are average moves upon average moves. Just because we're hyper focused on the one minute chart. We tend to lose sight of the fact that we're building 36 ip swings inside of an average daily candle, so on and so forth. Right? If you look at the weekly candle today, Wednesday, you know, the midday of the week. You've already accomplished the Euro USD ADR, the the weekly range has already been met. And so there's a high likelihood as of today. That we start doing this, even though we've been doing this all week. Right, so this type of stuff happens day in day out. It's now time to show up on schedule. Appreciate what's been happening in the last 16 hours since you, you know, were here last. And pick up the ball and run. It's the top down, not the bottom up. That lets you see what it is you're trying to build, you know, um, again, we, we have to put ourselves into the mindset of writing coattails, and you're going to say, well, who's whose coattails are we trying to get onto? Let me show you. Uh, you've, I'm sure you've seen this, uh, smart money idea, you know, all these concepts. Uh, I lifted this off the internet a while back. Uh, let's see if I can just move it. There we go. So you have the interbank markets, you know, the, the biggest of the bigs, right, they're basically control it for the rest of us. They supply the herd, right? Uh, you and I are in here, we're the smallest of the smallest compared to the biggest of the bigs. Right? And then they basically have their own thing to do, and they're doing it flawlessly. Right? Why are they pushing things and pulling things when there's nothing happening, when there's no news event, the market still has an ability to find its way up and down, you know, 9 pips. When there is a news event, when there is a catalyst, it may move the market for days. And then there's a pullback, right? There's always a push and a pull, there's always a distribution of funds and an accumulation of funds, and this is where we come in. Right? What have we been doing? What have I been teaching everybody to do? Sell at resistance, right? Sell when it's expensive, distribute. Who are, who are you distributing it to? Who are you selling to? On the way up. You are selling to someone who thinks it's going higher. In reality, we are selling. Because we think it's going lower. Right, so we're riding the biggest of the big coattails. We are not trying to pick tops or pick bottoms, we just happen to be here to form it. We are participating in the making of the top, in the making of the bottom. And this will happen on every time frame out there. And so I'm teaching you on the one minute chart because we only have one hour together. In this hour, this sorry one minute chart. Bins 1440 minutes per day. Right, so if this daily candle, if the daily chart makes one rotation. Your one minute chart is making 1440 rotations per day. Depending on where you show up, I show up on schedule every single day. I'm always trading the same 4 hour candle, or at least I'm trading within the same 4 hour candle every day, and it doesn't matter if I show up at the high of the day or the low of the day. I have a pretty good idea of what's coming next. Right? And then what's coming next is usually what's unwelcome for most. An extreme A falls break, a trap. This is why you'll see me buying 1 box, 2 boxes, 3 boxes, because eventually I'm right, and I'm right 97% of the time. Right? Because this behavior does not fail. It's not my behavior. I'm just trying to keep up to the guy with 12 zeros. Right, so we do the top down analysis, trying to figure out which way is this rolling. I don't want to be going opposite to the steamroller like we did yesterday. Right? Yesterday was a perfect example of that. We got away by the skin of our teeth. All right, so if there's any other questions, that's kind of the idea behind the three topics that I had in mind for today. Yeah, any questions, feel free to admit to yourself or post in the chat, and then John O and cover them and answer your questions there. Yeah we had a quick question here about the the pairs. What pairs do you recommend to trade for someone who want to trades the New York and London session? Uh, well, if, uh, the London and the New York session, so, uh, Euro USD would work really well, or the euro pound. If you want to focus more of your efforts on the North American time zone, make sure you have the USD as part of your equation, but if you're a European based trader, focus your efforts with the euro. Right, if you're, uh, if you're In the antipodeans, you know, if you're at opposite poles, uh, if you're in the Asia Pacific Rim, then maybe look at Aussie or New Zealand. It's this idea that the volatility comes and goes, but it's not random. And so if I go back. I think I mentioned that yesterday. If uh if you pick your battles just right, you'll have consistency overall, like a lot of large numbers. And so if you're focusing your efforts in the European session, anything with, you know, the pound Swiss or the EuroSwiss, anything that's hyper focused in that area of the world will give you better, more consistent, more predictable results. Right, but if I'm, you know, if I'm based in North America and I wipe the sleep out of my eyes to go trade at one o'clock in the morning, uh, I better make that a routine, because if it's just a one off, I'm bound to blow up. I, I just don't know what I'm faced with, um, Go to this website, maha.net. Go to Forex trading tools, it will come up with this page full of, here, here, this one, yeah. Depending on where you are on the planet, volatility is critically important to our message. And correlation may be something that interests you, uh, if you don't want to be a specialist in just one pair, but I, I try to, I look at correlations before I, I step out of the box. Before I go taking trades into other instruments, I want to see how highly correlated they are to the traits I already have. And I don't want to put all my eggs in one basket, you know, like the Euro CAD is 92% correlated to the Euro New Zealand. I, I don't want to double up on my risk on stuff like this. OK, so, yeah, these are just things that we look at after a little while, your process takes most of this stuff into account, right? This is that top down analysis that we do. Oh, where's our boxes? How did that behave? Look at that. Hey, look at that. Just like freaking magic. Just like magic. Right, so that's one, that's the euro box. Let's go see our S&P box. The S&P box is maintaining the box. Let's go see the Nas box. The Nas box is in the box though. OK. So this is one way of looking into the future with very limited visibility. Right, you don't want to be projecting into tomorrow. There's too much unknown between now and tomorrow, but the probability that the next hour reflects the last hour is extremely good. And at some point of the day, I showed you this on Matta, I showed you this on this website. There is a time and place every day where this relationship starts to slip and you need to get out. OK. So we'll leave it at that. Uh, it's been about an hour or so since we started. If you have any other questions, post them in Slack and I'll answer them for everybody to see. If you question in the chat, you wanna have a look, uh, also you have, uh, yeah, if you can open the chat, maybe that's better. Oh yeah. And you say you were trying to draw down. Yeah, you could, you could put one big position instead, uh, The problem with that though is it doesn't give you the ability to remove slices. You're basically locking yourself in into removing the entire hedge, and that creates a problem with some of the prop firms. I know with my own account, I don't want to go without some kind of protection, and so I would rather peel off slices of the hedge. Instead of just closing it all at once, and then that instant, I'm open to risk. Uh, how about crypto? Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, same, uh, the correlation is absent, right? Don't look at crypto as a safe haven, right? It's a risk asset. It always has been, always will be, but there's definitely cycles, there's definitely data on the left, there's definitely a box. Right, so, uh, you have to spend a little bit of time in that same 2 hour window, whatever time frame you choose, study it, understand what its upper and lower boundaries are. On average, what do you see, right? When I show up every morning, on average, the market has a very tough time going in either direction, more than 36 bits. That's just what I've come to realize for my euro. And so I've I've become accustomed to that range. I, I know how to behave inside there without busting a sweat. That's kind of what you have to do for your crypto. And then once you understand what your limits are, what the market's capacity to reach those limits are, you then, you know, size appropriately. Right? It's like understanding what the battle is before you get into the battle, right? You want to see the boundaries, who's on your flank, who's in front, all that good stuff. Well, a lot of trading is not random, and we were lied to. We were told this is just, you know. Moving at will at random, and it's just not like that. These are measured moves. And we have this deciphered how to, you know, come up with a pretty good average. Think of this as trying to figure out the weather. Right, if you figure out the weather 2 weeks from now, your success rate will be almost 0. But if you try and figure out the weather in the next 10 minutes, your success goes up almost through the roof. What do you mean make a test? Sure, yeah, we can put Bitcoin on here right now. That makes no difference to me. It's not the strategy that's flawed. All right, let's see. Market watch, see if I can add Bitcoin to this. OK. Go to 5 minutes. Zoom out. Put Bellinger bands on here. Let's get rid of this. Put Bollinger bands on there. Push Charts, so I can see it and zoom in, zoom in, zoom in. Here's your box. Right, so take that box. Give yourself a few spares. It's actually 4 spares. This would revisit the lows. And then if you care for, if you suspect it's a reversal or maybe it's pulling back. Maybe try and see where that potential can lead you. To the upside. Right? What's the potential here? Can the market go all the way here? Yes. Can it go all the way down here? Yes. Right, so what do you do? First, you do your top down analysis, so you figure out a bias. Clearly I want to be bearish as crypto, so I'm gonna put this down here and assume. That the price will remain inside these 4 boxes in the course of 2 hours. That's it. Yeah, yeah, if they're trending down, if the market is as a trend, if the market has a clear trend, lower highs, lower lows, right? Low low. Lower high, this is a clear down trend. You can start up there. And then just stack and stack and stack and stack and stack. There's one missing at the bottom here, we'll put that one right there. And then the market left that low and starting to go back up again. Right, so we can put one here. We can put one there, and we failed to go to the top of the box, so now we're coming back down again. The box is just the way. Of looking at what the potential is. The potential swing starts from a swing high or a swing low, just like it started here. Right, it started right up at the top. Swing high. And then we broke out a few bars into it. And then we broke out again. And then we broke out again. Right, that's all this is. It's just a way of what. of envisioning. What the market can do. No, not on Bitcoin. You have to figure out what the actual boxes. And give yourselves 4 times this much, right? So that box right there is $50 or 50 points. You have to give yourself 4 times this. Right, it's actually 3 standard deviation, but we give an extra 1. Because we want to survive box 3. OK, so this is it, friends. I'm just gonna stop the recording here. If you have more questions, put them in in the slack group. Go ahead and try this by yourself, you know, me telling you all of this is pointless unless you go and try it. It just won't sink in, right? You, you have to see it to believe it, and if you do it, you'll believe it that much more. All right. Enjoy yourselves, straight safe, straight small, and yeah, remember 3 standard deviations is what the market is out for, right? It's looking to move these 3 standards. Over and over and over, we use a 4th 1 just to be safe, right? And we, we plan for this. It's this is not random. OK. Trade safe fellas, ladies and gents, and I'll see you soon. Bye bye. So sure. Mm. Maybe you stop recording. Fe to close the call, I think you're the host now, but I'm good. Yeah. Awesome, OK. And then, uh, yeah, did you want me to send you the links to this or send you the actual recordings? Oh yes the recording, yeah, we should be good. OK, perfect. I'll do that. Thank you. Bye bye.


## 20 2024 September - Top Down Analysis  Fixing Losing Trades aac

Mhm. OK, well, I'm gonna, I'm gonna start, OK, I guess I will admit all first and then mute all, so I will have to unmute you. Sure. All right, we'll try that. Well, uh, just before you go, before you go, if you, if you see that little arrow on the participants button. Uh-huh, yeah. It, uh, so if you right click on the participants button. You can see, you can see the list of who's here. And then there's a uh a host tools. Yes. If, if you click on the host tools, you can mute everybody at once. You can do a whole bunch of stuff there at once. And, and so it's a lot easier. OK? All right, thank you. I'll uh everybody. Thank you. All right, thank you. So let's see. OK. So let me see everything over here. All right, everybody. Welcome to today's session. Um, so today is the 2nd, uh, mastery scalping session. Um, I have, let me see, let me just make sure this is all good. I'm pretty sure I tried to mute everybody, but let me do this do this again. I'm trying to mute everyone just so you guys know so that we don't have any interruptions. Um, whenever you have any questions, please feel free to, um, uh, unmute yourselves and ask a question. Now, today we have several topics that we're going to be talking about. Um, I'm just going to introduce him real quick so you guys know what to expect, and then I'm going to um let Jean Josa do do his thing. So, um, the three topics today will be how to fix losing traits with other positions. Um, we will also be talking about how to determine a bias for the day and then, um, how to trade the strategy during the UK session. OK, so let me see, Jean-Francois, um, you can. You can get going. And you need to unmute yourself. There we go. Good morning, good afternoon. Good evening, everyone. Uh, it's the 18th of September, and we are looking at 10 o'clock Eastern time on FOMC Day of all things. And so we have some times before the main event, uh, we have about 4 hours, so let's cover the topics that we've been tasked to review. Uh, the first one was fixing losing trades. So that's something that uh OK, so let's take a step back. Uh, we're dealing with a high probability strategy, so our targets are achieved consistently, right? So this is now at a rate of 90%. And so in order to fix losing trades, we're gonna be managing groups of trades, right? So we're no longer fixing just one or two, we're fixing one or two groups, right? Because we're breaking up the entries in the first place, right? So now imagine yourself trading 1% at one particular level. And all of a sudden you're in drawdown and you put a 2nd 1% to work at a different level. The average of 2%. Is what we're dealing with, right? So on the chart, if you can see my chart. I'll show you what I'm talking about, right? So let's say we take a trade up here, we're trying to go long and the market fell down. So we take a 2nd trade. The average of the two trades is in the middle. Somewhere here in, you know, in this vicinity. The break even is literally at our doorstep. We're almost in the money. We're not losing, but we're also not making anything. Right? The problem is in our mind, we're not here to break even. We're here to make money. And so to fix a bad trade, in our mind, requires profit. In reality, breaking even is more than adequate, and to take break even requires practice, right? So to engineer break even is easy, but to actually click the button is the difficult part, right? So, the mathematics is really simple. And when we start to deal with the boxes, Our objective is to play bounces in box number one, right? So if I put, let's say I create a a box, this is, for example, my box. And I put my box on the low, and we've broken, so now I would put a 2nd box. And the break was false, so we're back in. So let's say I sell this. Right? And then I have one trade. That one trade is trade number one in box number one. And automatically, if if it's wrong, if it is not bouncing, if it's not going my way, bouncing off the top of the box. And going down and and instead goes up. I'm immediately in drawdown. I'm immediately in fix it mode. Right, but it's not a losing trait. Right, I'm immediately averaging to the original trade in order to get a better price. I'm not worried about the original trade being a loser, right? So we have to define loss and drawdown. And we operate within so much drawdown. In our case, it's 36 pips. And losing happens beyond 36 lips, right? So, the problem is in our mind, taking a break even is just not good enough. And it requires the practice to do so, right? So here we are making 3 pips within, you know, a couple of minutes. Uh, I'll just book it so I don't have to fix it. Right, so this is the key to the strategy, right? That's kind of what we want to do, high probability 98% of the time. If things don't work out, so let's try that again, and now we're, you know, if it keeps going up and up and up and up, and I'm trying to get myself into drawdown. Let's say I I close this into profit. And I buy instead, right? So let's say I'm thinking bullish, and I'm trying to buy, buy, I take two trades. If the market drops, And I have to add to this, I'm creating an average. The average becomes the target. Once I, I get to this target, I must click the button. And that allows me literally to reset everything. And start from scratch. Maybe I can start on the bearish side. Maybe I can restart with half the size, right? Uh, maybe I can. Take the next few minutes off and let things settle down, or prove, prove a situation, right? So here I am now in drawdown. In our mind, we see this as a problem, we see this as a loss. Reality, it's drawdown. It's expected to happen, it's part of the system, and it's exploitable. I can use this to get a better price. If I take 2 more entries and add to the existing 2. So now I've moved the average price of the 4 entries. The average price is a fraction of a pip away. It's 1 pip away. It's less than 1 pip away. Because I added. To the, to, to my position. Right, I can create the exit that I'm looking for by spending money, and by the same token, I can book everything. If we go beyond breaking even. Right, so this is beyond breaking even. We're past break even. I can close all of my trades as winners. Boom, boom. Um So Right? So, in essence, in order to Engineer way out in order to fix a bad trait. You have to either book it as a loss, so take it out of the drawdown column and put it into the loser column, and that money is officially gone. Or you spend a little bit more money. And you engineer an average cost. Remember that term, because this is kind of what we do all day every day, whether you're trading CFDs or futures. Right? Average cost is what you're trying to get. Over, right? You're trying to overtake this average cost. In the world of Forex, it's Over it's plus spread. Right, we have to take average costs of our entries plus the spread. We have to cross the spread. Right, same thing here. Right, so if I take a trade. Let's say I want to buy. Let's say I'm trying to make 3 pips and the market falls. In my brain, oh my God, this is not working out. This is a loser. In reality, it's only drawdown. I have space, right? Drawdown is space. There's my stop loss. Inside of that space, I can engineer whatever I need to do to get my way out of that losing trade. Right? So, how do I do that? Like an insurance company, I'll send an adjuster to the car crash. I'll send, you know, I'll refuse to pay the claim until I have more evidence, right? I need to, I, I need to fight, fight, fight, fight, fight, before I just say, OK, here's your money, right? I have to do something with this before it gets to here. And something might be booking a loss, so taking it off altogether. While it's still cheap. Or spend a little bit more money. And fix it Right, so now, boom, I have two trades. I am officially fixing the first rate. By spending more money. Right, so I have an average cost, that's the aqua colored line. And in in this environment, I'm controlling average cost. Right, if I want to change where that is, I can take a loss. Right, and now all of a sudden, I'm left with only one trade. I've booked a tiny, tiny, tiny loser, and my drawdown is again manageable. It's only, you know, a half a box. Right, I can reopen. I can put back to work. The loser that I just took. Right, so I took one loss. At the top of the box, and I put it back to work at the bottom of the box, and I still have an average of the two traits. I am controlling where the average is. I am forever fixing trade number one, unless it goes into profit. Which entitles me to reopen it, recycle it. Right? So, fixing a trade is an inherent part of the process. It's what we do all day every day. We're forever fixing trade number one, otherwise it's closing into profit. And we do that to a degree where box number 1 turns into box number 2. So now we have 2 boxes average to each other. That's a total of 8 traits, potential 8 traits. Right? If it's still going a little bit further, but you have the audacity to believe, you know, that you're right, which I do often because I believe in my statistics. I trust my I trust my ranges, I trust my measurements. The audacity is, is allowed, you know, I, I have an allowance. Built in At PI 37, my psychology changes very drastically. This is where the potential for hedging may come into play. That's a different, you know, fixing method, but that entitles, you know, even more money to be put to work, and that could be a greater risk, right? So going back to this business here. What you're trying to do when you take a loser. is first to define it as a loss and take it off the books. Otherwise, it's only drawdown. And if it's only drawdown, it's work in progress. So all of a sudden, you should be a little less anxious and a little bit more focused about, you know, what to do next, and what to do next is a function of the market. Right? We react. If the market went up an average move. Over and over and over and over. If it goes down in average, maybe it goes up in average, same thing back and forth. Right, are we going to exploit this average move? Right, I think so. This is what we've been doing. Right, so we see an average, we exploit an average, and if it's within in our world, 3 of those averages, everything is normal. If it reaches a 4th, We anticipate Losses in the 5th, right? So we're already thinking if it goes beyond that. But within those 1st 4 boxes, it's all about the bounce, playing for the bounce, and the bounce could be to break even. Right, it doesn't have to be to the target. Right? So if you're already into trouble, or you feel like you're into trouble, things have not been working out. Engineer Move the target. Move break even. And do that by spending money. Right, so that's basically fixing what we call losing traits, right? They're not losers, they're in drawdown. Losers happened over here. And that's, you know, beyond this, it's called hedging. We covered that a while back. At this point here, it's an ejection seat and we should just obey it, right? You should just eject. Within this space, you have trades that average with trades, which end up being boxes averaging with boxes, and you have a total of 4. Right, so maximum 16 clicks. If you're doing this with futures, cut everything in half. OK, so here we are, we need to average the 2. And moves that break even line. Right, so now if I can get it within an average move away, that's the key, you know, an average leg away, so this is an average leg down. If I can get my break even within an average move. It's very, very, very likely that the market will cross into me. It will cross my break even. By moving on average, by just doing an average pullback. Right, so Something like this. Right, so if this is the result of what's coming next. It's going to break even. Right, what my job is is to find or move that blue line so that eventually we cross it. That's it. And as soon as we get to there, we, we get out. Right? So I think topic number 2 is to cover the bias, a top-down analysis type of, you know, question. Uh, how would we go about doing the top down, and I think the, the third topic was, uh, how to trade this method in the UK session, so 8 hours before North America. I'm gonna switch the two topics and do them in a in a different order. We'll we'll talk about the UK session first. Because that leads to the bias, right? So, uh, if you were to operate in Europe, you're basically following the Asia session. And the new day, the brand new day, as far as a European trader is concerned, is only 8 hours old. Right, the brand new day started at the start of Asia. And when Europe starts, it's the end of the Asia session. Right, so when Europe starts, you're looking to your left. As a European trader, you only have 24 hour candles to look at. When I walk up to the computer and I look at the computer and I look into the new day. When I walk up to the computer and I look to the left, there are 4 candles there for me to look at. I'm looking left to 16 hours of history. And when I look at that, I tend to do it. As an aggregate, I look at 16 hours on the daily scale. As a European trader, you don't have the luxury of aggregating 16 hours' worth of data, because you only have 8 hours' worth of data. So you're best to stay on the 4 hour candle. And compare the 4 hour candle that you're walking into. With the previous one that just closed, like the same way that I do my top down with the daily, right? I compare highs, I compare lows, I compare directionality. And, and so if I, in this case, we've made. An even high, oops sorry. It's not a higher high, it's not a lower high, it's double top. We can't call this a top unless we break the low. And we're on our way there now, right? So the rotation has already taken place. And so if I was walking into this as a European trader, comparing a current 4 hour candle with the one that's already closed, this rotation here would make me bearish. And that's kind of where we start, right? Then you, you zoom into this. 8 hour window. On the hourly scale. And now you know you've been here for 8 hours. You want to see how it's taking shape, what's happened? How did it evolve? The same way we do, you know, when I do this at 10 Eastern, and then you would highlight the ceiling, highlight the floor, highlight everything in between, and then play for a break. I'm just gonna add to this so I can continue to fix. Where did my window go here. 6 30 and today being the FOMC, uh, I don't wanna go too crazy with, you know, fixing things. And so I'm just gonna slow down the clicks. Nonetheless, you can see break even. Breakeven is within. 7 pips. Right, and we know an average move is 9 pips. And so if this is for the sake of argument, support, and we start to bounce from here. We can conceivably get to break even within a box. These boxes are the wrong dimensions, these are fake boxes. Right, so I've engineered, I've moved my average cost, so this is my cost for having opened. Or this is my average price, sorry, for having opened 123456 straight. Right, and if we can get there on the way there, we're closing a couple of trees. I have to recycle them. Otherwise this moves have been on that. Uh, somebody asking a question. So I'm not gonna make that mistake. So I will take short double size, not moving. And so we're looking to when we do the top-down analysis from a European standpoint, you're looking at 4 hour candles where I'm looking at daily candlesticks. OK, so that's the only difference between, you know, the thesis, uh, how we approach the thesis. It's the review. You're trying to step into something that's already underway, but you have less history to refer to. So a 4 hour candle, the current one, the one you're stepping into right now, is already open and it's heading to a close. Compare it with the candle before that's already closed. And the reason why we want to do this in steps and starting from the top is typically you have different groups of traders, which so happens to be the daily chart, right, happens to be the smallest time frame for some traders, right? The people with the most zeros in their trading accounts. They take their entries on the daily chart, and then they do nothing for weeks. Right, so very different from what we're doing here, and here I am having to recycle. In order to keep break even within reach. Right, so I just took back the same two traits that closed. I've pulled back break even. Nothing here is a loser. I'm just fixing trade number one. I'm repairing trade number one, which is yet to close into profit. Right, it's still a high probability trade, but it requires work. Right, so going back to the bias, the 4 hour chart replicates. What I do because I have more history to refer to, right? So that leads us to this bias, right? The UK session, you, you take your bias, you do your top down from the 4 hour, then you step maybe use the 30 minutes instead of the hourly chart. You have to step into, it's like focusing in under the microscope. And then we focus a little bit more. And you end up trading on the one minute, just like I'm doing. And the bias is acquired from the top, and like I mentioned before, groups of traders control different time frames, so to speak, and they have money to spend. And, you know, some of them consider minute charts noise. It's this noise that makes the daily candle. And the way today closes compared to yesterday may prompt billions of dollars to be put to work. Right. Today, for example, FOMC Day is one of those days, right? Today may be a catalyst for weeks to come. And so, today is a perfect example of this. Lots of money will be poured in or taken out of circulation because of what Mr. Powell will say today, right? So what we're trying to accomplish as a short term scalper is we see this steamroller coming, and we try to be, you know, uh, out. Before the steamroller gets here, and we know in our case, it's 3.5 hours from now. Right, so we have to be done daily trading before 3.5 hours from now. are bias from the top down. It's almost like an alignment sort of strategy, right? If you can align multiple time frames together, so they both tell you bullish or they both tell you bearish. Your probability of success goes up tremendously. If one tells you one and the opposite time frame tells or another time frame tells you the opposite, you may end up uh Pulling your hair out, like, you have to choose one versus the other and commit. And so here I am recycling the same trades again. Actually, I'm adding a little bit more. Right, so I'm still, as we speak, like an insurance company, spending a little bit more money, it's within. When I'm allowed to do day by day by day, so nothing here is outside of the norm. My job is to pull on this blue line to a degree where it's achievable, bounce a normal event should be able to take me there. In fact, that we're only 6 bits away. Is a good, is a good, you know, a good clue, a good hint that it's achievable. Right, so it, it's, it's the definition of loss. The loss in this world doesn't happen until we get here, and this is as defined an ejection seat. We just book it, and you book that loss. Our job is to engineer an exit. So engineer break even before you're forced to eject. And engineering break even takes place, starts. As soon as trade number one is not closing. Right, so basically as soon as box number one is in drawdown. You're, you're automatically in fix it mode. Right, so we've touched on Uh, you know, the repair slash definition of drawdown versus loss. At some point hedging may be the thing to do, but for most of you, it's illegal to hedge. It's, no, it's against your regulations. For some of you, uh, hedging will be a skill you pick up in due time, right? You have to learn to lose before you learn hedging. It's just a natural progression of things. And then, uh, the UK session with this particular method, the boxes themselves don't change. The way you operate with the boxes doesn't change what you do in and out of the market, you know, you're Uh, uh. Your approach to risk management doesn't change. The only difference is when you initiate the top-down analysis, instead of starting on the day, start on the 4 hour candle. Right, so that Basically keeps you with blinders on. It keeps you from expecting a move to the moon. Without having enough information to warrant it. Right, so By touching on baby steps, you know, by So we have, that's the oil news that just came out. By taking uh by taking a baby step approach to all of this stuff and taking bite-size trades, micro lots, mini lots, you buy yourself a, you know, a 2 million trade career. Right, it's when you put it all on the line, on the day like today, you're likely going to blow up. So our approach is really To take one step at a time and have the information. Provided to you before you take the trade, right? I want to be at the top of the box before I click. I want to be at the bottom of the, or I want to be at support. I want to be at resistance. It's, it's not random, click, click, click, click, click, click here, there and everywhere cause I feel happy. It's, it's measured, right? And if we measure this, it's probably approaching a normal standard move, right? We're just beyond two boxes here. We have 20 pips. This was probably the 1718, yeah. So we're just beyond 2 boxes. This may have been enough of a pullback, and now we start more boxes. We just don't know the future. All we know is average moves stack up. And if they stack in a certain in a certain direction after a little while, they're bound to reverse. Nothing is for sure, right? It's just a game of probabilities. We're already at 26, we're near 27. Right. Give it to 27 pips and then watch for a bounce. Right around here would be a good place for a bounce. Makes sense? Right? It's just a unit of measure. We expect a little bit of a bounce, and it's not to the moon. But maybe back to Resistance. Slash support, support may become resistance. So we'll see, right? So, Top-down analysis, bias, they go hand in hand, and depending on where you are, if you're in Asia, you have even less data to ref to make reference to. Right, the the day is brand spanking new. It only has a few minutes. So you're referring to yesterday's clothes candle, and you're comparing it with the day before. And you're trying to forecast. What the likelihood is for today, right? It's a probability. And I'll tell you right now, as an Asian based trader, your highest probability of success is to first look at the daily pivot. Right. Yesterday's high low closed divided by 3. That would be the best target as an Asian trader, you know, it's a high probability setup, 70 to 80% of the time. Uh, and, and so that it's not a guarantee, but it's, it's a way of Asserting uh a bias for the day. At least it's a starting point, and then you can adjust as you go, right? So, Uh, fixing losing trades first define what a losses. In our world, it has to be outside of 37 pips. And you know, in order to get there, you've had to have run out of uh alternatives. You've run out of Uh, uh, tools in your tool bag, you know, you've run out of stuff to do. Or you've run out of bullets, because it's an averaging game, and when you average with one trade, you're averaging price. And the key to this is to get average moves. Average moves in distance to cross your average price, like a trip wire. So you set up a trap and you move the trap as the market keeps moving. And you can only do that with a maximum of 16 tricks. I'm already halfway there. Right, so I'll put a couple more here. And watch that line to come down. And now that line is within reach. 12 tips were just outside of a regular box. And so if I get the opportunity to recycle a little bit more, I shall do so. We're not being picky, we're just being uh opportunistic. Right. The market has a directionality, I may be in line with it, or I may be upside down. As long as I'm within 36 pips. I have an opportunity to reach this. Because it's unlikely to be a straight shot down. It's unlikely going to go straight down without having some kind of a pullback. Right, and the pull back is what you're hoping for. That's what you're praying for. Except it's measured to be that aqua line. And if it comes shy of this, if it comes short of this aqua line, it's up to us to just book it. Look it as such. Makes sense. I just took a bunch of wins in one of my other accounts. If you heard it, that's what it was. And so, uh, here, we're still targeting breaking even. It's still within reach. It's not an unruly amount. If things don't work out, things go the wrong way, we don't lose everything at once unless it keeps going and going and going and going. We may lose a couple of trades and it turns around. We may lose a couple of stacks and it turns around. Right? The idea is that we continue to book, book, book, book, book, book, book, book profits, right? The high probability continues. We just Learn to get back on the horse and continue. Right, so fixing the losing trades first define them. And then average your way out, average cost. If you're dealing in the world of futures. This is what I was doing this morning, uh, before we had our our session. I was working with average cost. I did it there, I did it over here. Right on the way up. And on the way down. And then the market opened, and I stopped. I don't like to do this kind of stuff once the market is open. Uh, I trade pre-market or aftermarket for the most part, and then I tend to focus my efforts on Forex, uh. When I'm trading with you guys or, you know, on my own. Right, so the, the idea is to have a plan, execute the plan, have alternatives or the willingness to adjust, you know, in my, in my case, I create alternatives and I just execute alternatives. I switch to plan B, I switch to Plan C. Instead of being pushed into a panic or stressed about something, I've already thought it out or think I did, or like it's one of the plan, or it's a it's somewhere in between there, it's not a stressful situation anymore. It's a matter of execution. Right, so the bias must come from the top. So you start on the highest time frame. That, you know, for us a daily is high enough. And if you can't get a daily chart because the data is not there, start on the 4 hour chart. 4 hour compared to the previous 4 hour. And just simple price action methodologies. Are you making higher highs? Are you making lower lows? Is it a doji? Is it a pin bar? What's happening? Zoom into this, and you'll get your bias. Right, and then understand you're not here for the ride to the moon. Or a submarine ride, you know, you're here for a couple of hours. And so in our world, that couple of hours is the next move. But it may not be starting right away, right? You have to finish the current move. In our world, right here, the current move is falling. The next move is probably starting right now. I'm booking wins and now entitled to recycle. Right, I'm just gonna pull that blue line back down. Right, so I, I want to be able to control the outcome or at least say that I did everything that I could. I, I don't want to be a deer in the headlights. I don't want to see. The stop loss get taken out, and I did nothing. To stop it. I did nothing but watch as things progressed against me. That's, that's the opposite to this system, this system requires that you get yourself involved. And Uh, no, knee deep. Uh, the idea is to break down the pieces as small as possible, so that you have as many as possible. And now you have the luxury of spreading them as you see fit, right? To the outside observer, this looks totally crazy. Like, why is he buying when things are falling? Because I'm not chasing this. Right, I'm preparing for the next move, a bounce of some kind, maybe right here. Right. And so the probability is there. It's a matter of conviction. And clicking that that mouse button, you know, if you, if you believe in your probabilities, which I have a tendency to do. Right, so it's not that. I've never been wrong, quite the opposite. I've gotten burned so often that now I trust. What works. I, I put money where the probability is, and when things are not looking so hot or shifting away, I have a tendency to put less money or not trade at all. Right, so there's there's Two ways of looking at this. You can go at it from the profit side. Chase, you know, make money. I want a million by Friday, or look at it by the risk lens, you know, through the, the, the lens of risk and try to be here for 20 years. I tried to be here to try to survive for a career. Not just a flash in the pan, that requires breaking down our expectations to baby size. Bites You know, tiny tiny profits, tiny, tiny. Parcels and 2 million of them over the next 20 years. OK, so what we're doing is controlling the environment with within. A range with within an expected range. In this case, we're almost at the 36 peps. We're at 31. Right, and things are bouncing our way. I just recycled more trades, break even, moved away from me. I'm still trying to fix box number one. I'm still trying to fix trades #1 and 2. And so I will pull down on my break even a little bit more, and I'm still not maxed out. I still have 6 clicks to spare. Right, the key is that blue line. Where's that blue line and how can I optimize getting there? I can move that blue line. If I go here and close my worst loser. Right? Boom, I just took one loss, and now the blue line is achievable, more so than it was before I took that loss. Right? It's the willingness to lose that made this. Achievable. Right, it sounds crazy, right, the willingness to lose. I'm not just here to chase profits. I'm here to do what's right for the account. Right, and so if losing or booking a loss, taking it out of drawdown and putting it into the loss column. That's in that that's a, there's no undoing this. Right? You can't, you can't erase it. It's there for life. It's a loss, it's books. I would rather do everything I can to not have that loss in my book, right? This is the ejection seat from my jet plane. My job is to fly the plane and bring it back. I'm, I'm expected to not eject. Right, so like an airplane pilot, I have things I must do before I pull the ejection handle right there's a whole host of checklists that I can experiment with before I must bail out. And some of that may require spending fuel, you know. Throwing off or getting rid of extra weight, whatever it is. Right? And so you do whatever you need to do to not get here. That comes at an expense, right? And in the end, what you're working with is the average price. It's, it's not just one trade anymore, right? That's what you do when you're swing trading, you're taking one trade. And you're waiting for one outcome. What we're doing here is taking that same percentages of risk. But we're breaking it up between a range. You know, between a high and a low, we're gonna spread 1%. And then the average of that work. is what you get paid with. So before I let you go for for today, I wanted to bring up uh Uh, where did I put it? This, uh, I, I'll, I'll be posting this in the, in the slack group as well. It's a spreadsheet. I've mentioned this before, or maybe a month or so ago, uh, I think this was before my forest fire evacuation. Uh, it's a spreadsheet that I created a while back. Basically, it's every one of you in the group now have tasted a little bit of consistency. You've had series of wins, you've managed to walk away every day, keeping your wins, so you've stepped out of the casino, a winner pockets full of chips. That's a pretty good feeling, and you don't have to, you know, work extra hard for this, right? It's, it kind of leads you to going to the beach every day. Imagine if you were able to do this for a year, maybe a year and a half. Your life would be changed forever, right? That little bit of consistency drives huge results if you just let it compound. And this is where I come in. This is why I, I preach this consistency instead of, you know, trying to hit it out of the park, right? So with the spreadsheet, it's just a model. It's allows you to go through and basically Uh Start small. Target small. And have a plan, and the plan is to earn the right to grow. Right, so people right now are trying to grow an account and withdraw money at the same time. They're trying to earn a salary. From an account that is not worth paying a salary from, right? So you have to break that down into two steps. First, you grow the account, and then you earn a salary, and that will take maybe 2 years, right? So the first year is all focused on the consistency, making that 20 pips per day or 20 trades per day, whatever it is you're Capable of on a daily basis, right? So that is your own personal average, right? PAY potential average yield is what you aim to extract, and what you do on average would go in here. And so at the end of that challenge, you'll notice, uh, at the beginning, sorry, at the beginning, you start with a small account, you target consistency. You target the same size each and every day like I've been doing in front of you guys, and then here you are about 50 days in. So on day 50, 51, you have earned the right to change your size. So now the account is a little bit bigger. And you're not risking more, it's just The risk is worth more. Right, so 1% now grew. You're still risking 1%. You're still making consistent returns, you're still trying to grow the account, right? So, a few days in, right there at day 76, you've now earned the right to grow again, right? So now your size is growing bigger because the account is growing bigger. You're still targeting the same thing every day. Trading is kind of boring that way. Right. Here you are at day 93. You've earned the right to grow again. You're still targeting the same boring average day. Right. Fast forward, let's go to day 131. So we're almost halfway. This is a 300 day challenge, so let's go to day 150. At day 150, halfway through the challenge, you've earned the right to grow to 1.1 lots. And you're trading an $11,000 account. If you do the entire challenge, you'll notice your size gets bigger and bigger and bigger, faster and faster and faster. Right, it's amortized. And then if you complete the challenge, 60 weeks of consistency. 300 days of consistency, you're trading almost a quarter of a million dollars, and you're doing it with 21 lots for 20 peps every day, and it's a $4000 day. It's a boring day. Doing the same thing for 300 days, but it's changed your life. Right, so now the 2nd year, you start with that new trading account. You're not trading minuscule anymore, you're trading substantial. This is where people go to prop firms. Oh, I don't want to risk my quarter of a million, and so I'm gonna go and rent it. I'll pay $250 US dollars or whatever it is, and I'll rent. Somebody else's money. And then with that, I can continue to do my average boring workday with 21 lots, 20 peps, and earn a salary. Right, so if you look at it, for those of us that are visual people. This is what it looks like. Right, but people are combining these two things. And then falling off the cart before the cart even gets moving. Right? So, in reality, the 1st 100 days are the most difficult. This is where you lose attention, this is where you lose focus, this is where you'll have 3 or 4 losing days in a row, and you'll throw the whole system away. But in reality, if you can survive 200 days, you can already see some substantial changes taking place. And the last 100 days just change your life. And it's because you're consistent. You know when to start, you know when to stop, you know what you're doing, you don't do anything more or anything less, and you're not following a million different YouTube channels and stuff like this. You're not listening to me. You're doing your own thing. Right? And so it's a matter of finding it, finding what you're looking for and extracting that. I, I chose to show 20 pips. You could be a 30 pip trader, you could be a 50 pip trader, you could be a 10 pip trader. Right? It doesn't have to be that much. It just has to be consistent, and then over time, everything changes, and it's the fascinating part is year 2. Year 2, you start with substantial. You earn the right to withdraw $80,000 a month. And the account continues to grow. Right? You can start a new business with this. You can do a million different things. This is that little hoo hoo train that could. Right? That's the little train engine that pulls the whole train forward. Right, the ideas behind this lies in discipline. Right? And then the first questions will be what happens if you have a losing day. Well, try and limit it to 20 pips, so you end up moving forward one or falling back one. It's not snakes and ladders. You don't want to do 100 pips forward and fall 300 pips, right? You do 20 forward and stop, go to the beach. Or you lose 20 you stop and go to the beach, right? It's simple, simple, simple. It's almost too simple that we're gonna overcomplicate this by over trading. And most people will give up literally before day 100 hits the clock. Right, before they've changed their account. By any amount they'll they'll throw in the towel. Right, so, uh, there's references here, uh, you know, if you compound. Uh, Like 0.25% per day, you've heard me say that multiple times. We're looking to not break the bank, not make a million dollars by the weekend, but 0.25% per day. If you can make a 0.25% per day, that's 5% a month. If you compound 5% a month for a year, that's 80%. There's not a business on the planet that pays 80% a year. Right? This is something you must strive for, and a 0.25% per day, some of you guys are already doing this, but because of of our psychology, you can't stop there, you overdo it, and by Friday you've given it all back. That spreadsheet is a model to allow you to kind of focus. And understand that you do have the right to grow. But you have to earn it. Right, and then in doing so, you experience, you know, a year and a half worth of different market conditions. This will make you a uh battle tested traitor. And it's only asking for 20 pips per day. If you go to YouTube and you type in 20 Pip challenge, everybody tries to make a million bucks to as fewer trades as possible. Using 20 pips. This is turning that equation around. This is spreading it out so that you don't blow up by the weekend. Right? So, yeah, there's a million ways of skinning a cat. You just have to figure out what works best. And for those of us that have this particular psychology, consistency is the key. Right? Consistency is the key, and here I am having to recycle and pull down on my average a little bit more. And then by not changing my size, not changing my targets. I, uh, I add or subtract from my float, right? I'm floating the same amount more or less, day in, day out, right? It's within 16 clicks, and it's never the same trading conditions. Like, for example, today I'm running against the clock, right? I'm trying to be done before Jerome Powell. Uh, that's unbecoming. I usually don't do this, you know, uh, I, I would be done by now. The, the problem is, We want to earn income, and we want to see success throughout, but we don't see the difference between Success and Too much risk. Uh on the day like today, it tips the scale versus towards too much risk. All right. So on a day like today, skills or no skills, uh, do very, very little. Wait for the facts to come out, right? And then trade the facts. Tomorrow. The fog of war will have lifted. We'll have a much clearer picture if we're gonna get a 50 basis point cut or 25%. The market's been pricing in 50, and I think the market's gonna get its ass kicked today, right? Watch Jerome Powell deliver 25. Right, so, anyways, I've said my piece for today, so I hope this was useful. Uh, I'll be posting this spreadsheet in the Slack group in the, in the scalping section there, and you know, ask questions there as you see fit. OK, folks, we'll we'll be in touch. Trade safe everyone. OK, thank you, Jean Francois and thank you everybody who joined. Um, remember to also ask any questions you might have on the, in the Slack channel. So if anything comes up after this call, just feel free to uh go in there and ask and um yeah, we'll see you on the next call then. Thank you. Yeah, remember the spreadsheet is just a model. It's just a guideline to show you what is potentially available. It it's a, it's a way of, it's a carrot that we can chase, right? So, but we're in control. We're in control and if you find bugs and and whatever it is in that spreadsheet, go ahead, you know, fix it, do whatever you want with it. It's all yours to play with. All right. Enjoy yourselves, folks. All right, thanks everybody. Have a good rest of the day. Bye-bye.
